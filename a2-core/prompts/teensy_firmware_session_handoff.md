### Specific Tasks for This Session:

1. **PlatformIO Project Setup**
   - Initialize/confirm project structure in `~/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/`
   - Create `platformio.ini` configured for Teensy 4.1 + FreeRTOS
   - Set up proper build flags and library dependencies

2. **FreeRTOS Task Implementation**
   - Implement basic task stubs in `src/main.cpp`:
     - `safetyMonitorTask`
     - `actuatorFeedbackTask`
     - `imuProcessingTask`
     - `serialCommunicationTask`
     - `heartbeatTask`
   - Ensure tasks are created and scheduler starts properly

3. **UART Communication Module**
   - Create `src/serial_comms.h` and `src/serial_comms.cpp`
   - Define UART packet structure (start bytes, length, command ID, payload, checksum)
   - Implement helper functions for packet creation and validation
   - Include CRC16-CCITT checksum calculation

4. **Serial Communication Task**
   - Handle sending packets from FreeRTOS queue
   - Receive bytes from UART into buffer
   - Detect potential start of packets (full parsing comes later)

5. **Heartbeat Task**
   - Blink LED_BUILTIN
   - Prepare and queue simple status/version packets
   - Send via serialCommunicationTask every 1 second

### Reference Documents (Available in ~/A2/a2-docs/):

**Primary References:**
- `teensy_firmware_design.md` - Sections 3.1 (RTOS Tasks), 4.1 (Frame Structure), 4.2 (Message Types)
- `a2-implementation-guide.md` - Week 1 milestone details
- `local_development_setup.md` - Development environment guidance

**Architecture Context:**
- `hybrid_architecture_overview.md` - Overall system design
- `expressive_motion_primitives.md` - Motion system requirements
- `phase_1_executive_summary.md` - Project overview and timeline

### Files to Create/Modify:

```

├── platformio.ini                 # Create/modify
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp                  # Create/modify
│   ├── serial_comms.h            # Create

└── lib/                          # May be created by PlatformIO
```

## Technical Specifications

### Hardware Target:
- **MCU**: Teensy 4.1 (ARM Cortex-M7, 600MHz)
- **RTOS**: FreeRTOS
- **Communication**: UART (USB Serial for development)
- **GPIO**: LED_BUILTIN for heartbeat indication

### UART Packet Structure (from design docs):
```
[START_BYTE_1][START_BYTE_2][LENGTH][COMMAND_ID][PAYLOAD...][CRC16_HIGH][CRC16_LOW]
```

### Key FreeRTOS Tasks:
- **safetyMonitorTask**: 1kHz safety loop (highest priority)
- **actuatorFeedbackTask**: Servo position feedback
- **imuProcessingTask**: IMU data processing
- **serialCommunicationTask**: UART communication handling
- **heartbeatTask**: Status indication and telemetry

## Development Approach

### Phase 1 Week 1 Goals:
- **Success Metric**: 100Hz IMU data streaming, servo sine wave demo
- **Focus**: Establish reliable robot ↔ computer communication
- **Deliverable**: Real-time sensor data in ROS, single servo control

### Local-First Development Strategy:
- Develop and test locally on WSL with connected hardware
- Minimal cloud dependencies during development phase
- Use cost optimization strategies documented in `cost_optimization_strategies.md`

## Specific Questions for Implementation:

1. **PlatformIO Configuration**: "Provide a well-structured `platformio.ini` file for Teensy 4.1 project using FreeRTOS. Include build flags and library dependencies for CRC and FreeRTOS."

2. **Packet Structure**: "Suggest C++ struct(s) for UART packet and `CMD_TEENSY_FIRMWARE_VERSION` payload. Include CRC16-CCITT checksum function."

3. **Serial Communication**: "Outline `serial_comms.h/.cpp` structure with function prototypes for UART init, packet sending, and non-blocking receive."

4. **Task Creation**: "Provide FreeRTOS task creation calls in `main.cpp` for all five tasks with basic task function skeletons using `vTaskDelayUntil`."

5. **Heartbeat Implementation**: "Show `heartbeatTask` implementation that toggles LED_BUILTIN and queues version packets using FreeRTOS queue."

6. **Serial Task Loop**: "Illustrate `serialCommunicationTask` core loop checking FreeRTOS queue for outgoing packets and UART for incoming bytes."

## Expected Session Outcome

By the end of this session, you should have:
- ✅ Working PlatformIO project for Teensy 4.1
- ✅ FreeRTOS tasks running with proper scheduling
- ✅ Basic UART communication framework
- ✅ Heartbeat LED blinking and status packet transmission
- ✅ Foundation for Week 1 milestone completion

## Next Steps After This Session

1. **Hardware Integration**: Connect sensors (IMU, servos) and test communication
2. **ROS 2 Bridge**: Implement Pi-side communication to receive Teensy data
3. **Servo Control**: Add basic servo movement commands
4. **Week 1 Validation**: Achieve 100Hz IMU streaming and servo sine wave demo
