# A2 Documentation Archive

This directory contains deprecated documentation that has been superseded by current designs, as well as working documents and process files that are no longer needed for active development.

## Archive Structure

### 2025-05-deprecated/
Documentation deprecated in May 2025 during the documentation cleanup process:

- **single-camera-approach/**: Reserved for any future documents describing Arducam ToF-centric designs (none found in current codebase)
- **old-sensor-configs/**: Reserved for previous sensor mounting and wiring approaches (none found in current codebase)
- **superseded-implementations/**: Reserved for outdated implementation strategies (none found in current codebase)
- **process-documents/**: Documentation cleanup process files that are no longer needed for active development

## Archived Documents

### Process Documents (2025-05-27)
- **cleanup.md**: 13-prompt documentation cleanup process instructions (COMPLETED)
- **NEXT_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF.md**: Assistant handoff instructions (COMPLETED)

**Reason for Archival**: The documentation cleanup process has been completed successfully. These instruction documents are no longer needed for active development but are preserved for historical reference.

**Forwarding Notices**: Both files have been replaced with forwarding notices in their original locations pointing to the archived versions.

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when they:
1. Describe deprecated technical approaches that have been superseded
2. Contain process instructions that have been completed
3. Are working documents that are no longer actively maintained
4. Conflict with current architecture decisions
