## 7. Next Steps and Future Documentation (Directions for Continued Work)

This section outlines immediate priorities for finalizing Phase 1 documentation and areas for future documentation as the project progresses into implementation and beyond.

### 7.1. Immediate Documentation TODOs for Phase 1:

1.  **Finalize Hardware Documents:**
    -   **Review and Update `cad-specifications.md`:** Ensure complete alignment with the final `bill_of_materials.md`, the `wiring_guide.md`, and any physical design implications from the hybrid architecture (e.g., enclosure space for all listed components, thermal management for Raspberry Pi 5/drivers, cable routing for tethers if RTX 4080 system is a separate PC). Confirm specific details like L16 ball joint material choices and servo mounting.
2.  **Define Phase 1 Behavioral Testing Scenarios:**
    -   Update **`phase_1_behavioral_testing_scenarios.md`**. This should be a lightweight document detailing a few specific, simple interaction scenarios to test the "Hello World - Spoken & Embodied" POC goal from Sprint 4 of the `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`.
3.  **Update this Master Document:** As new documents are finalized or major changes occur.

### 7.2. Documentation During/After Phase 1 Implementation:

-   **Implementation Notes & Deviations:** Maintain a log or add sections to each design document detailing any deviations made during actual implementation, specific parameters chosen, and lessons learned.
-   **Detailed Application Programming Interface (API) Documentation (Cloud):** Auto-generate OpenAPI/Swagger specs for all cloud FastAPI services (Master Shared State System (MSSS), LLMs, Conversational Speech Model (CSM)).
-   **URDF File for A2:** Create and document the Unified Robot Description Format file.
-   **ROS 2 Humble Launch Files:** Document the main launch files used to bring up the robot's systems (local and for interacting with cloud).
-   **Setup and Deployment Guides:**
    -   Step-by-step guide for setting up the Raspberry Pi 5 environment.
    -   Guide for deploying Teensy 4.1 firmware.
    -   Guide for deploying local RTX 4080 system services (Docker).
    -   Guide for deploying cloud services to RunPod instance (Docker Compose, environment variables).
-   **User Guide for Telemetry UI.**
-   **Troubleshooting Guide.**

### 7.3. Documentation for Phase 2 and Beyond:

-   Detailed design for advanced conflict resolution (Master Shared State System (MSSS) & Execution Router).
-   Design for push-based state synchronization (WebSockets/gRPC).
-   Advanced network resilience and comprehensive "offline personality" scripts.
-   Detailed designs for any new perception modules or reflex behaviors.
-   Documentation for any new hardware (e.g., arms, legs, new sensors).
-   Updated behavioral testing for complex emergent behaviors.

## 1. Purpose and Vision

This document outlines the hybrid cloud-local system architecture for the A2 Robotic Assistant. The primary goal is to enable complex, intelligent, and expressive robotic behavior by strategically combining onboard processing for real-time tasks with cloud computing for resource-intensive AI computations. This architecture is designed for responsive interaction, sophisticated reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs), and natural-sounding custom Text-to-Speech (Text-to-Speech (TTS)), while providing a clear path for future scalability, modularity, and feature expansion (such as limbs).

The vision is a robotic platform where:
-   **Local processing** (onboard the robot) handles immediate safety, physical reflexes, direct hardware control, and time-sensitive perception tasks.
-   **Cloud processing** (e.g., hosted on RunPod) provides the advanced cognitive functions, including a Multi-Large Language Model (LLM) Swarm for reasoning and dialogue, and a Conversational Speech Model (Conversational Speech Model (CSM)) for high-fidelity Text-to-Speech (TTS).
-   Communication between local and cloud tiers is optimized for interactive responsiveness, with particular attention to minimizing perceived latency for speech and reactions.

### 1.1. Phase 1 Refined Architecture Focus

The refined architecture prioritizes **motion quality and expression capability** while maintaining the proven hybrid approach. **Phase 1 (Refined Core)** focuses on:

**Motion Control Revolution:**

-   **500Hz impedance overlay** providing virtual spring-damper model for smooth motion
-   **100Hz motion primitives** from ROS 2 via UDP, eliminating scheduler jitter
-   **Antenna expression system** with MG996R + LX224 servos for emotional communication

**Hybrid Intelligence Pipeline:**
-   Enhanced safety layers (P0 @ 1kHz, P1 @ 100Hz) with impedance-aware monitoring
-   Cloud Gateway optimized for motion primitive commands and telemetry
-   Multi-LLM Swarm integration with motion context awareness
-   Expression-synchronized TTS with antenna coordination

**Key Achievement:** Apple-grade motion fluidity with $120 additional hardware investment while preserving all existing hybrid architecture benefits.

-   **Interaction:** Via Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    -   **Phase 1:** LLMs may be simplified or mocked to test pipeline. Focus on data flow and basic directive generation.

#### 3.2.2. Conversational Speech Model (Conversational Speech Model (CSM) - Containerized Service)
-   **Implementation:** Based on Sesame Conversational Speech Model (CSM) (`csm_tts_integration.md`).
-   **Responsibilities:** Generates natural-sounding speech with a custom cloned voice. Receives text from cloud Communication Large Language Model (LLM). Streams audio to Cloud Gateway.
    -   **Phase 1:** Focus on successful voice cloning and reliable audio streaming.

#### 3.2.3. Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS) - Cloud)
-   **Implementation:** Redis-backed database with a FastAPI layer (`a2_master_shared_state_cloud_design.md`).
-   **Responsibilities:** Authoritative system state, inter-Large Language Model (LLM) coordination, cloud-side conflict resolution.
    -   **Phase 1:** Simplified conflict resolution (hierarchical). Robot Gateway polls for updates.

## 4. Data Flow and Communication Strategy

### 4.1. Onboard Data Loops

-   **P0 Safety Loop (Teensy 4.1):** Sensor -> P0 Logic -> Actuator Enable Control / Alert to Raspberry Pi 5.
-   **P1 Reflex Loop (Raspberry Pi 5):** Local Sensor Processing -> Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) -> Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) -> P1 Command -> Execution Router -> Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) -> Actuators.
-   **Local Perception Loop (Raspberry Pi 5 <> Local RTX 4080 system):** Raw Sensors (Intel RealSense D455, Mic on Raspberry Pi 5) -> Data to RTX 4080 system -> Vision/Speech-to-Text (STT) Processing on RTX 4080 system -> Processed Data back to Raspberry Pi 5 (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) / Cloud Gateway).

### 4.2. Hybrid Local-Cloud Interaction Loop (Simplified for Phase 1)

1.  **Input:** User speaks. Local Mic (Raspberry Pi 5) -> Audio to Local Speech-to-Text (STT) (RTX 4080 system) -> Transcribed text.
2.  **Uplink Context:** Cloud Gateway (Raspberry Pi 5) sends transcribed text and summarized local state (from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)) to relevant cloud Large Language Model (LLM) APIs (e.g., Communication Large Language Model (LLM) or Decision Large Language Model (LLM) via Master Shared State System (MSSS) update).
3.  **Cloud Processing:**
    -   Cloud LLMs process input and current Master Shared State System (MSSS) state.
    -   Communication Large Language Model (LLM) formulates text response and expression hints, posts to Master Shared State System (MSSS), and triggers Conversational Speech Model (CSM).
    -   Decision Large Language Model (LLM) updates goals/behavioral mode, posts to Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    -   Motion Large Language Model (LLM) generates abstract motion plan based on Master Shared State System (MSSS) directives, posts to Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    -   Master Shared State System (MSSS) Conflict Resolution (simplified) finalizes directives in `resolved_robot_directives_queue`.
    -   Conversational Speech Model (CSM) streams synthesized audio.
4.  **Downlink Directives & Audio:**
    -   Cloud Gateway (Raspberry Pi 5) polls Master Shared State System (MSSS) for `resolved_robot_directives_queue`, receives motion/gesture/expression commands.
    -   Simultaneously, Cloud Gateway receives audio stream from Conversational Speech Model (CSM).
5.  **Local Execution:**
    -   Cloud Gateway updates Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) with new directives and publishes audio stream.
    -   Local Audio Playback node (Raspberry Pi 5) plays audio.
    -   Execution Router (Raspberry Pi 5) reads directives from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC), applies P0/P1 overrides, and commands Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) to move actuators.

### 4.3. Inter-Cloud Communication

-   Cloud LLMs, Master Shared State System (MSSS), and Conversational Speech Model (CSM) interact via internal cloud network APIs or message queues.

### 4.4. WebSocket State Streaming

The A2 system implements real-time state synchronization using WebSocket connections to replace polling-based communication, enabling more responsive and efficient cloud-local coordination.

#### 4.4.1. Event-Driven State Updates
-   **WebSocket Connection:** Persistent bidirectional connection between Cloud Gateway and Master Shared State System (MSSS)
-   **State Change Events:** Master Shared State System (MSSS) pushes updates immediately when state changes occur
-   **Selective Updates:** Only changed state components are transmitted (delta compression)
-   **Priority Queuing:** Critical updates (safety, expressions) sent with higher priority

#### 4.4.2. Local State Prediction During Network Latency
-   **Predictive Modeling:** Local system predicts likely state changes during network delays
-   **Rollback Mechanism:** Corrections applied when actual cloud state differs from prediction
-   **Confidence Scoring:** Predictions include confidence levels for decision making
-   **Graceful Degradation:** System continues with local predictions if connection lost

#### 4.4.3. Connection Management
-   **Automatic Reconnection:** Exponential backoff retry strategy for dropped connections
-   **Heartbeat Protocol:** Regular ping/pong to detect connection health
-   **State Resynchronization:** Full state sync on reconnection to ensure consistency
-   **Fallback to Polling:** Automatic fallback if WebSocket connection unstable

#### 4.4.4. Performance Benefits
-   **Reduced Latency:** Immediate state updates vs polling intervals
-   **Lower Bandwidth:** Delta updates vs full state transfers
-   **Better Responsiveness:** Real-time reaction to cloud decisions
-   **Resource Efficiency:** Reduced CPU usage from eliminated polling loops

## 5. Latency Management and Responsiveness

-   **Local Tiers (P0, P1):** Designed for <10ms and <75ms responses respectively.
-   **Cloud Interaction Loop (Phase 1 Target):** Aim for <2-2.5 seconds from end of user speech to start of robot's spoken and embodied response. This is challenging and requires optimization at each step.
-   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Streaming:** Conversational Speech Model (CSM) audio streaming is critical. Target <700ms from text available at Conversational Speech Model (CSM) to first audio chunk playback on robot.
-   **Local RTX 4080 system Tasks:** Vision/Speech-to-Text (STT) processing expected within 50-300ms depending on model complexity.

## 6. Benefits of Hybrid Architecture (Reiteration)

-   **Scalable Intelligence:** Cloud handles heavy AI lifting.
-   **Real-time Safety & Control:** Local systems ensure immediate responsiveness.
-   **Cost Efficiency:** Optimized use of local vs. cloud compute.
-   **Advanced Features:** Enables use of large, powerful AI models.
-   **Modularity:** Clear separation for development and upgrades.

### 6.1. Expression-Driven Latency Targets

The A2 Robot's expressive capabilities require carefully tuned latency targets that balance technical constraints with natural interaction patterns. These targets are designed around human perception of responsive, emotionally coherent robotic behavior.

#### 6.1.1. Reflex Responses: <75ms (Unchanged)
-   **P0 Safety Responses:** <10ms for emergency stops and collision avoidance
-   **P1 Fast Reflexes:** <75ms for environmental reactions (loud sounds, movement detection)
-   **Justification:** Matches human startle response times, maintains believable reactive behavior
-   **Implementation:** Local processing only, no cloud dependency

#### 6.1.2. Speech Onset to Motion: <200ms
-   **Gesture Initiation:** Physical movement begins within 200ms of speech start
-   **Expression Synchronization:** Facial/head expressions align with vocal emotional tone
-   **Breathing Simulation:** Subtle platform movements synchronized with speech rhythm
-   **Justification:** Maintains tight coupling between verbal and physical expression, mimics natural human speech-gesture coordination

#### 6.1.3. Full Interaction Loop: 2.5-4s Acceptable Range
-   **Optimal Target:** 2.5 seconds from user speech end to robot response start
-   **Acceptable Range:** Up to 4 seconds for complex reasoning tasks
-   **Breakdown:**
    -   Speech-to-Text (STT) Processing: 500-800ms
    -   Cloud Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning: 1000-2000ms
    -   Text-to-Speech (TTS) Generation: 700-1000ms
    -   Motion Planning: 200-400ms
-   **Justification:** Matches natural conversation pacing, allows for thoughtful responses

#### 6.1.4. Expression Quality vs Latency Trade-offs
-   **High-Priority Expressions:** Curiosity, alertness, acknowledgment (<200ms)
-   **Medium-Priority Expressions:** Emotional responses, complex gestures (<500ms)
-   **Low-Priority Expressions:** Narrative gestures, environmental scanning (<1000ms)
-   **Degradation Strategy:** Simpler expressions used when latency constraints cannot be met

#### 6.1.5. Context-Aware Latency Adaptation
-   **Conversation State:** Faster responses during active dialogue, slower during ambient mode
-   **User Patience Modeling:** Adapt timing based on user interaction patterns
-   **Expression Urgency:** Safety-related expressions always prioritized
-   **Predictive Pre-computation:** Anticipate likely responses to reduce perceived latency

## 7. Evolution Beyond Phase 1

Post-Phase 1, the architecture will be enhanced with:
-   More sophisticated conflict resolution in Master Shared State System (MSSS) and Execution Router.
-   Push-based state synchronization (WebSockets/gRPC) for Master Shared State System (MSSS)-Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   Advanced network resilience and more detailed "offline personality" scripts.
-   Full implementation of all designed local perception and reflex modules.
-   Richer expressive capabilities and more nuanced Large Language Model (LLM) coordination.
-   Preparation for physical expansion (arms, legs) by maturing motion planning and state representation.

This hybrid architecture, implemented iteratively starting with a focused Phase 1, provides a robust and adaptable framework for the A2 Robot to achieve its goal of intelligent and expressive human-robot interaction.

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the custom ROS 2 Humble message (`.msg`), service (`.srv`), and action (`.action`) definitions for the A2 Robotic Assistant project. These definitions form the common language used for inter-node communication within the A2's ROS 2 Humble ecosystem, both onboard and potentially for communication with simulation or external tools.

These interface definitions will be part of a dedicated ROS 2 Humble package, typically named `a2_interfaces`. Each definition will be in its own file (e.g., `RobotStatus.msg`, `GetStateValue.srv`).

Standard ROS 2 Humble message types (from `std_msgs`, `sensor_msgs`, `geometry_msgs`, `diagnostic_msgs`, `trajectory_msgs`, `audio_common_msgs`, etc.) will be used wherever appropriate to maintain compatibility and reduce custom definitions.

## 3. Service Definitions (`.srv`)

### 3.1. `GetStateValue.srv`

For Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) to provide specific state values on request.

```ros2srv

# GetStateValue.srv

string json_path_query      # e.g., "local_robot_physical_state.servos_feedback.yaw.current_pos_deg"

## 4. Action Definitions (`.action`)

Actions might be useful for longer-running tasks managed by the `Execution Router` or other nodes, but simple topic-based commands are often sufficient for this type of robot. If complex, interruptible, feedback-rich tasks are needed, actions would be defined here.
Example:

### `ExecuteMotionSequence.action` (Hypothetical, if Execution Router exposed actions)

```ros2action

# ExecuteMotionSequence.action

# Goal

CloudMotionCommand[] motion_sequence
bool interruptible
- --

# Result

uint8 RESULT_SUCCESS = 0
uint8 RESULT_PREEMPTED = 1
uint8 RESULT_FAILED = 2
uint8 result_code
string final_status_message

# Feedback

string current_primitive_id
float32 percent_complete_overall

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Local Shared State Cache (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)) is an onboard component running on the A2 Robot's Raspberry Pi 5. It serves as a fast-access, local replica of essential parts of the Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS)) which is hosted in the cloud. The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) is crucial for enabling responsive local behaviors, providing context to onboard perception systems, and buffering directives from the cloud for local execution.

The primary purposes of the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) are:
-   To provide local ROS 2 Humble nodes with quick access to relevant robot state and cloud-derived directives without each node needing to directly query the cloud.
-   To decouple local real-time operations from the latency and potential intermittency of cloud communication.
-   To store a subset of the robot's state that is generated or updated locally (e.g., raw/processed sensor data, detailed actuator status) before it's summarized and sent to the cloud by the `Cloud Gateway Node`.
-   To act as the immediate source of truth for the `Execution Router` and other fast-acting local modules.

## 2. Architectural Placement and Technology

-   **Hosting:** Runs as a dedicated ROS 2 Humble node or a service integrated within a core local management node on the Raspberry Pi 5. Likely part of the `a2_state` ROS 2 Humble package.
-   **Technology:**
    -   **Primary Store (In-Memory):** For extremely fast access, the core Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) data structures can be managed directly in the memory of the ROS 2 Humble node (e.g., Python dictionaries, C++ structs/classes).
    -   **Optional Local Persistence/Caching (Redis on Raspberry Pi 5):** For more complex querying, larger local state history, or if multiple local non-ROS processes need access, a lightweight local Redis instance running on the Raspberry Pi 5 could be employed. For initial simplicity, in-memory management within a ROS node might suffice if the state size is manageable. We'll assume in-memory within a ROS 2 Humble node for this design first.
    -   **Synchronization:** Primarily updated by the `Cloud Gateway Node` with data from the Master Shared State System (MSSS), and by local nodes publishing their own status.

## 3. State Vector Structure (Local Subset and Additions)

The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) holds a subset of the Master Shared State System (MSSS) structure, plus local-only detailed information. Key differences and additions:

```json
{
  "version_lssc": "1.0.0", // Local cache version
  "timestamp_lssc_update_utc": "2025-05-17T10:15:00Z",
  "cloud_sync_status": {
    "last_msss_directives_timestamp_utc": "2025-05-17T10:14:55Z",
    "connectivity_to_cloud": "connected", // "connected", "degraded", "disconnected"
    "last_uplink_timestamp_utc": "2025-05-17T10:14:58Z"
  },

  "local_robot_physical_state": { // Detailed, high-frequency local physical state
    "actuators_feedback": { // From Teensy 4.1 via Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)
      "l16_a": { "current_pos_mm": 45.2, "current_load_mA": 150, "status": "ok" },
      // ... other L16s
    },

      // ... other servos
    },
    "imu_head": { /* raw and fused data from head MPU9250 */ },
    "imu_base": { /* raw and fused data from base MPU9250 */ },
    "power_monitoring": { /* from INA260 sensors */
        "main_voltage_v": 12.1, "main_current_a": 2.5
    },
    "calculated_pose": { /* Combined pose from kinematics and IMUs */ }
  },

  "local_perception_state": { // Outputs from local perception (RTX 4080 system / Raspberry Pi 5)
    "vision_detections": [ /* From local YOLO node */ ],
    "stt_transcription_local": { // If local Speech-to-Text (STT) is active
        "text": "Hello robot", "confidence": 0.9, "timestamp_stt_utc": "2025-05-17T10:14:50Z"
    },
    "audio_doa_local": { /* Direction of arrival from mic array */ }
  },

  "active_directives_for_execution": { // Pulled from Master Shared State System (MSSS) via Cloud Gateway, ready for Execution Router
    "motion_commands": [ /* { "primitive_id": "prim_001", "type": "smooth_orient_head", ... } */ ],
    "speech_text_to_play": null, // Text for local Text-to-Speech (TTS) fallback, or for logging what Conversational Speech Model (CSM) *should* be saying
    "gesture_commands_to_execute": [ /* { "type": "nod", "priority": 3 } */ ],
    "expression_commands_to_execute": {},
    "last_updated_from_cloud_utc": "2025-05-17T10:14:55Z"
  },

  "cached_cloud_context": { // A subset of context from Master Shared State System (MSSS) for local reference
    "environment_model_summary": { /* Key persons, objects relevant to immediate action */ },
    "current_behavior_mode_from_cloud": "attentive_listening",
    "active_goals_summary_from_cloud": [ /* Simplified goal list */ ]
  },

  "local_system_status": {
    "teensy_status": "connected",
    "raspberry_pi_cpu_load": 0.65,
    "local_rtx4080_status": "operational", // Heartbeat from services on 4080
    "ros_node_health": { /* Status of critical local ROS nodes */ }
  }
}```

-   **Local Emphasis:** Sections like `local_robot_physical_state` and `local_perception_state` are richer and higher-frequency here than what might be summarized for the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   **`active_directives_for_execution`:** This is crucial. It's populated by the `Cloud Gateway Node` from the Master Shared State System (MSSS)'s `resolved_directives_for_robot` and is the direct input queue for the `Execution Router`.

## 4. Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) Node ROS 2 Humble Interface (`a2_state` package)

### 4.1. Publishers (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) broadcasts its state)

-   **`/shared_state/local_cache` (`a2_interfaces/LocalSharedState`):** Publishes the entire Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) (or significant parts of it) periodically and on change. Local nodes subscribe to this to get a consistent view.
-   **Granular Topics (Optional but Recommended):**
    -   `/shared_state/local_cache/physical_state` (`a2_interfaces/LocalRobotPhysicalState`)
    -   `/shared_state/local_cache/perception_state` (`a2_interfaces/LocalPerceptionState`)
    -   `/shared_state/local_cache/active_directives` (`a2_interfaces/ActiveDirectivesForExecution`)
    -   These allow nodes to subscribe only to the parts they need, reducing processing overhead.

### 4.2. Subscriptions (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) gathers local updates)

The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) node itself (or a closely related manager node) subscribes to topics from various local hardware interfaces and processing nodes:
-   `/teensy/actuator_feedback` (`a2_interfaces/ActuatorFeedbackArray`): From the Teensy 4.1 interface node.
-   `/dynamixel/status` (`a2_interfaces/DynamixelStatusArray`): From the Dynamixel control node.
-   `/imu/head/data` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`): From the head Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) processing node.
-   `/imu/base/data` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`): From the base Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) processing node.
-   `/power/monitor/all` (`a2_interfaces/PowerMonitorArray`): From power monitoring nodes.
-   `/vision/local_detections` (`a2_interfaces/DetectionArray`): From local vision on RTX 4080 system.
-   `/audio/local_stt/transcription` (`std_msgs/String`): From local Speech-to-Text (STT) on RTX 4080 system.
-   `/audio/local_doa` (`a2_interfaces/DirectionOfArrival`): From local audio processing.
-   **`/shared_state/cloud_update` (`a2_interfaces/SharedStateFragment` or `a2_interfaces/ActiveDirectivesForExecution`): Crucially, from the `Cloud Gateway Node`, carrying updates from the Master Shared State System (MSSS).**

### 4.3. Services (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) provides services for direct query/update)

-   **`GET /shared_state/local_cache/get_value` (`a2_interfaces/GetStateValue.srv`):**
    -   Request: JSONPath-like string to specify the desired state variable.
    -   Response: Value of the state variable.
    -   Allows synchronous fetching for nodes that need it.
-   **`POST /shared_state/local_cache/update_value` (`a2_interfaces/UpdateStateValue.srv`):**
    -   Request: JSONPath-like string and the new value.
    -   Response: Success/failure.
    -   For local nodes to directly push updates (e.g., a calibration routine updating a parameter). Use with care to maintain consistency.

## 5. Data Flow and Update Mechanisms

1.  **Local-to-Local Shared State Cache (LSSC):**
    -   Hardware interface nodes (Teensy 4.1 comms, Dynamixel controller, sensor processors) publish their data at their native rates.
    -   The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) node subscribes to these topics and updates its in-memory structures.
    -   On significant change, or periodically, the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) publishes its updated state (or relevant parts) via `/shared_state/local_cache/*` topics.
2.  **Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)-to-Cloud (via Cloud Gateway):**
    -   The `Cloud Gateway Node` subscribes to key parts of `/shared_state/local_cache` (or specific aggregated topics).
    -   It filters, summarizes, and formats this data to send to the Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) (`POST /state/update_from_robot`).
3.  **Cloud-to-Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) (via Cloud Gateway):**
    -   The `Cloud Gateway Node` polls the Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) (`GET /state/directives_for_robot` and potentially other state fragments).
    -   When new data is received from Master Shared State System (MSSS), the `Cloud Gateway Node` publishes it to `/shared_state/cloud_update`.
    -   The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) node subscribes to `/shared_state/cloud_update` and merges this information into its state, particularly into `active_directives_for_execution` and `cached_cloud_context`.
4.  **Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)-to-Local Consumers:**
    -   Local nodes like `Execution Router`, `Fast Path Reflexes`, and perception systems subscribe to `/shared_state/local_cache/*` topics to get the latest relevant information.
    -   The `Execution Router` specifically watches `/shared_state/local_cache/active_directives` to know what cloud-derived (and locally prioritized) commands to execute.

## 6. Conflict Resolution (Local Context)

-   **Primary Conflict Resolution in Master Shared State System (MSSS):** The most significant conflict resolution (between different cloud Large Language Model (LLM) intentions) happens in the Master Shared State System (MSSS). The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) receives already *resolved* directives for high-level tasks.
-   **Local Overrides / Safety:** The `Execution Router` (consuming from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)) still implements its own priority system. This means:
    -   Ultra-fast safety commands (from Teensy 4.1, directly to Execution Router or via a high-priority Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) update) can preempt anything from the cloud.
    -   Fast-path reflex commands (from Raspberry Pi 5, also high priority) can preempt cloud directives.
-   The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) itself doesn't do much conflict resolution but faithfully reflects the latest updates. The `Execution Router` is the final arbiter for what *actually* moves, based on the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)'s `active_directives_for_execution` and its own safety/reflex inputs.

## 7. Performance Considerations

-   **Update Frequency:** The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) node must be efficient enough to handle high-frequency updates from local sensors while also processing updates from the cloud.
-   **Publishing Strategy:** Publish on change for critical data. For less critical or very high-frequency data, publish at a throttled rate (e.g., 10-30 Hz) to avoid overwhelming the local ROS network.
-   **Data Structures:** Using efficient in-memory data structures (e.g., Python dictionaries optimized with `__slots__` if applicable, or well-designed C++ classes) is key.
-   **ROS 2 Humble QoS:** Appropriate Quality of Service settings for publishers and subscribers (e.g., `Keep Last` for state, `Reliable` for critical commands).

## 8. Resilience and Fallbacks

-   **If Cloud Disconnected:** The `Cloud Gateway Node` will update `cloud_sync_status.connectivity_to_cloud` to "disconnected".
    -   The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) will continue to be updated by local sensors.
    -   `active_directives_for_execution` will not receive new cloud commands. The robot might:
        -   Complete its last known cloud directive.
        -   Revert to a default "idle" or "local interaction only" behavior based on local perception (if such logic is implemented).
        -   Rely only on Fast Path reflexes and safety.
-   **Initialization:** On startup, the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) initializes with default values and then waits for updates from local nodes and the `Cloud Gateway`.

## 9. Testing

-   Test Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) update rates from all local publishers.
-   Test correct merging of cloud updates from the `Cloud Gateway`.
-   Verify that local consumers (especially `Execution Router`) receive timely and correct state from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   Simulate cloud disconnection and verify fallback behaviors based on Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) state.

The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) acts as the nervous system's local hub on the Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5, ensuring all onboard components have a consistent and timely view of the world and the robot's intentions, whether derived locally or from the cloud.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS)) is a critical cloud-hosted component in the A2 Robot's hybrid architecture. It serves as the authoritative, comprehensive repository for all information relevant to the robot's high-level reasoning, decision-making, and inter-Large Language Model (LLM) coordination. It enables the cloud-based Multi-Large Language Model (LLM) Swarm to operate cohesively and provides a mechanism for synchronizing essential state information with the robot's onboard systems.

The Master Shared State System (MSSS) aims to:
-   Provide a **single source of truth** for high-level state information accessible by all cloud AI services.
-   Integrate sensor data, Large Language Model (LLM) outputs, system status, and contextual information from both cloud and local sources.
-   Facilitate **reflection-based interaction** between the cloud LLMs (Communication, Decision, Motion).
-   Maintain a relevant **history of states** for contextual understanding and learning.
-   Offer an efficient mechanism for the robot's onboard `Cloud Gateway` to synchronize a local cache with pertinent state updates.
-   Incorporate a **Conflict Resolution Engine** for outputs generated by different cloud LLMs.

### 1.1. Phase 1 Implementation Scope

For the initial Phase 1 implementation (Essential Core), as outlined in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`, the Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS)) will focus on establishing core functionality with certain simplifications:

-   **Primary Store:** Redis will be implemented as the backing store.
-   **Application Programming Interface (API) Layer:** A basic FastAPI layer will expose essential endpoints for state updates from the robot (`/state/update_from_robot`), updates from cloud LLMs (`/state/update_from_llm`), and retrieval of resolved directives by the robot (`/state/directives_for_robot`).
-   **Simplified Conflict Resolution:** The initial Conflict Resolution Engine will use a basic hierarchical approach (detailed in Section 4.3). Complex rule-sets and blending are deferred.
-   **Synchronization:** The robot's `Cloud Gateway` will use a polling mechanism (detailed in Section 5) to retrieve directives. Push-based mechanisms are a future enhancement.
-   **State History:** Basic logging of state snapshots will be implemented; extensive versioning or the use of Redis Streams for detailed history is a Phase 2 goal.

## 2. Architectural Placement and Technology

-   **Hosting:** Deployed in the cloud environment (e.g., RunPod) alongside the Multi-Large Language Model (LLM) Swarm and Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service.
-   **Technology:**
    -   **Primary Store (Redis):** A Redis instance will serve as the high-performance, in-memory NoSQL database. Its speed, flexible data structures (hashes, lists, JSON), and pub/sub capabilities make it suitable.
    -   **Application Programming Interface (API) Layer (FastAPI):** A lightweight Python FastAPI service will provide a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) in front of Redis. This layer will manage access, enforce data schemas (using Pydantic models), handle complex queries/updates, and implement the logic for synchronization and conflict resolution.

## 3. State Vector Structure (Illustrative High-Level)

The Master Shared State System (MSSS) will store a structured state vector in Redis, likely as a JSON object or distributed across multiple Redis keys/hashes for granular access. Key top-level categories include:

```json
{
  "msss_schema_version": "1.0.0", // Schema version for this structure

    ]
  },

      // Example: { "goal_id": "goal_abc", "type_label": "answer_user_question", "status": "active", "priority_score": 0.9, "details_json": "{...}" }
    ],
    "attention_focus": { // Current focus of the robot's attention
      "target_id": "person_1", // ID of person, object, or spatial point
      "target_type": "person", // "person", "object", "spatial_point", "sound_source"
      "focus_level_norm": 0.9 // Normalized intensity of focus
    },
    "current_emotional_tone_directive": "friendly_and_curious" // Overall emotional tone for expressions
  },

  "conversation_module_context": { // State related to ongoing dialogue
    "current_interactant_id": "person_1",
    "dialogue_history_short_term": [ // Limited history for immediate Large Language Model (LLM) context
      // Example: { "turn_id": "turn_023", "speaker": "user", "text_transcription": "Hello A2, how are you?", "timestamp_utc": "..." },
      // Example: { "turn_id": "turn_024", "speaker": "A2", "text_generated": "Hello! I am functioning optimally. How can I assist you today?", "timestamp_utc": "..." }
    ],
    "last_user_interpreted_intent": "greeting_and_inquiry", // From Communication Large Language Model (LLM) NLU
    "active_conversation_topic": "initial_greeting_and_status"
  },

  "cloud_llm_pending_outputs": { // Staging area for raw outputs from cloud LLMs before conflict resolution
    "decision_llm_output": { /* structured output from Decision Large Language Model (LLM) */ },
    "motion_llm_output": { /* structured output from Motion Large Language Model (LLM) */ },
    "communication_llm_output": { /* structured output from Communication Large Language Model (LLM) */ }
  },

  "resolved_robot_directives_queue": { // Directives ready for the robot, post-conflict resolution
    "motion_commands_abstract": [ /* Array of { "command_id": "motion_cmd_001", "type": "orient_to_target", "target_id": "person_1", "priority_level": 2, "params_json": "{...}" } */ ],
    "speech_generation_request": { // Single request for Conversational Speech Model (CSM)
        "text_to_speak": "I am now processing your very interesting request.",
        "voice_id": "a2_default_voice",
        "request_id": "speech_req_002"
    },
    "gesture_commands_abstract": [ /* Array of { "command_id": "gesture_cmd_003", "type": "nod_agreement", "intensity_norm": 0.7, "priority_level": 3, "sync_with_speech_request_id": "speech_req_002" } */ ],
    "expression_commands_abstract": { /* Example: { "command_id": "expr_cmd_004", "primary_emotion_label": "thinking", "intensity_norm": 0.6 } */ },
    "last_resolved_timestamp_utc": "..." // When this set of directives was finalized
  },

    "decision_llm_heartbeat_utc": "...", "status_label": "operational",
    "motion_llm_heartbeat_utc": "...", "status_label": "operational",
    "csm_tts_heartbeat_utc": "...", "status_label": "operational",
    "last_robot_gateway_heartbeat_utc": "..." // From Cloud Gateway
  }
}
```

-   **Data Storage in Redis:**
    -   The entire state vector (or significant sub-sections like `environment_model`) will be stored as JSON strings in dedicated Redis keys (e.g., `robot:a2_default:state:full`, `robot:a2_default:state:environment_model`).
    -   Redis Hashes can be used for more granular updates to fields within these sub-sections if performance dictates.
    -   Short-term lists (e.g., `dialogue_history_short_term`) can use Redis Lists (`LPUSH`, `LTRIM`).
    -   The `resolved_robot_directives_queue` might be a simple key updated atomically, or a list if multiple sets of directives can be queued (though for Phase 1, a single overwritable set is simpler).

## 4. Core Operations and Application Programming Interface (API) (FastAPI Endpoints)

### 4.1. State Updates

-   **`POST /robot/{robot_id}/state_from_gateway`**:
    -   Used by the A2 `Cloud Gateway` to push curated local state information (e.g., processed sensor summaries, Speech-to-Text (STT) results, robot physical status).
    -   **Request Body:** JSON object containing relevant fragments of the local state to be merged into Master Shared State System (MSSS) (e.g., updates to `environment_model`, `conversation_module_context.last_user_utterance`).
    -   **Action:** The Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) validates and merges this information into the master state in Redis. This might trigger processing by the Decision Large Language Model (LLM) if significant changes are detected.
-   **`POST /robot/{robot_id}/llm_output/{llm_name}`**:
    -   (`llm_name` could be `decision`, `motion`, `communication`)
    -   Used by individual cloud Large Language Model (LLM) services to publish their outputs.
    -   **Request Body:** The Large Language Model (LLM)'s structured JSON output.
    -   **Action:** Stores the output in the corresponding field within `cloud_llm_pending_outputs`. Automatically triggers the Conflict Resolution Engine (see 4.3).

### 4.2. State Retrieval

-   **`GET /robot/{robot_id}/state/full`**:
    -   Retrieves the entire current master state vector. Primarily for LLMs needing broad context or for diagnostic tools.
-   **`GET /robot/{robot_id}/state/partial`**:
    -   **Query Parameters:** e.g., `paths=environment_model.detected_persons,conversation_module_context.dialogue_history_short_term`
    -   Retrieves specific parts of the state vector. Used by LLMs to fetch only necessary context, optimizing data transfer.
-   **`GET /robot/{robot_id}/directives_for_robot`**:
    -   Used by the A2 `Cloud Gateway` to poll for the latest set of `resolved_robot_directives_queue`.
    -   This endpoint is key for the robot-pull synchronization model. May include a timestamp query parameter (e.g., `?since_timestamp=...`) to fetch only if newer directives are available (Phase 2 optimization).

### 4.3. Conflict Resolution Engine

-   **Trigger:** Invoked automatically by the Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) layer after any cloud Large Language Model (LLM) service successfully posts to `/robot/{robot_id}/llm_output/{llm_name}`.
-   **Process (Phase 1 Simplified Hierarchical Logic):**
    1.  Fetches all fresh outputs from `cloud_llm_pending_outputs`.
    2.  Fetches relevant current context from the main state sections (e.g., `active_goals`, `current_behavioral_mode`).
    3.  Applies a simplified hierarchical logic to determine the final directives:
        -   **Primary Authority:** The **Decision Large Language Model (LLM)'s** outputs regarding overall goals (`active_goals_update`), behavioral mode (`current_behavioral_mode`), and high-level attention focus (`attention_focus`) are generally taken as the leading directives.
        -   **Communication Directives:** The **Communication Large Language Model (LLM)'s** `response_text_for_speech` is accepted if a speech action is consistent with the Decision Large Language Model (LLM)'s current behavioral mode. Its `expressive_gestures_desired` are considered.
        -   **Motion Directives:** The **Motion Large Language Model (LLM)'s** `motion_trajectory_primitives` are selected if they align with and support the active goals and behavioral mode set by the Decision Large Language Model (LLM). Abstract gesture requests from the Communication Large Language Model (LLM) may also be translated into motion primitives by the Motion Large Language Model (LLM) or resolved here.
        -   **Simplification:** In Phase 1, direct conflicts that are not resolvable by this simple hierarchy (e.g., Motion Large Language Model (LLM) proposes moving away while Decision Large Language Model (LLM) says engage) might result in the Decision Large Language Model (LLM)'s directive taking precedence, or a "hold/safe" state being commanded. Complex blending of conflicting high-level intentions is deferred.
    4.  The engine populates the `resolved_robot_directives_queue` section of the state with the outcome (motion commands, speech request, gesture/expression commands).
    5.  The processed entries in `cloud_llm_pending_outputs` are cleared or archived.
-   The goal is to produce a coherent set of actions for the robot, even with simplified logic in Phase 1.

## 5. Synchronization with Local Robot Cache

### 5.1. Robot Pull Model (Phase 1 Implementation)

1.  The `Cloud Gateway` on the A2 robot periodically (e.g., every 100-500ms, configurable) polls the `GET /robot/{robot_id}/directives_for_robot` Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint.
2.  The Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) returns the current content of `resolved_robot_directives_queue`.
3.  The `Cloud Gateway` receives this data and updates its Local Shared State Cache (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)), making the directives available to the onboard `Execution Router`.
4.  The polling interval is a critical tuning parameter balancing responsiveness and network/server load.

### 5.2. Cloud Push Model (Phase 2+ Enhancement)

-   Future enhancements will explore persistent connections (WebSockets, gRPC streaming) from the Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) to the `Cloud Gateway` for more immediate pushing of critical updates, reducing polling latency.

## 6. State History and Logging (Phase 1 Basic)

-   The Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) will log significant state changes and all incoming/outgoing Application Programming Interface (API) calls to a standard cloud logging service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, or a simpler file/database log on the RunPod instance).
-   Key state snapshots (e.g., the entire Master Shared State System (MSSS) JSON) might be saved periodically to cloud object storage for debugging and analysis.
-   Detailed, versioned history using Redis Streams or similar is deferred to Phase 2.

## 7. Scalability and Reliability (Phase 1 Focus)

-   **Redis:** A single robust Redis instance on RunPod is sufficient for Phase 1. Configuration will ensure persistence.
-   **Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) Layer (FastAPI):** A single instance of the FastAPI application is sufficient for Phase 1. Uvicorn/Gunicorn will be used for robust serving.
-   **Database Backups:** Manual or simple scheduled backups of the Redis RDB/AOF files.

## 8. Security

-   All Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints exposed externally (for the `Cloud Gateway`) MUST use HTTPS.
-   Application Programming Interface (API) requests from the `Cloud Gateway` and between cloud Large Language Model (LLM) services must be authenticated (e.g., using Application Programming Interface (API) keys in headers or JWTs).
-   Network security groups/firewalls in the cloud environment will restrict access to Redis and internal Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints.

## 9. Development and Testing

-   The Master Shared State System (MSSS) FastAPI application will have an OpenAPI (Swagger/ReDoc) specification generated automatically for clear Application Programming Interface (API) documentation.
-   Unit tests for Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint logic, Pydantic schema validation, conflict resolution rules (even simplified ones), and Redis interactions.
-   Integration tests will use mock cloud Large Language Model (LLM) services and a mock `Cloud Gateway` to simulate the full data flow, state updates, and directive resolution cycle.

This Master Shared State System, centered around Redis and a FastAPI layer, provides the necessary coordination backbone for the A2's cloud-based intelligence, adapted for a phased implementation.

express robot’s intention, attention, attitude, and emotions.

Nonverbal behaviors such as posture, gestures, and gaze are essential for conveying internal states, both consciously and unconsciously, in human interaction. For robots to interact more

Introduction

In this paper, we present ELEGNT, a framework of expressive
and functional movement design for non-anthropomorphic robot.
We argue that robots should not only move to fulfill functional
purposes and constraints but also move “elegantly” - using their
movements to express intentions, attention, and emotions to their
human counterparts during human-robot interactions (HRI). We
present our practice of designing movements incorporating functional and expressive utilities and a user research to understand
the effect of expressive movements.
Robots are increasingly entering homes as assistants and companions, making it essential to understand how they coexist with
humans, interact with people, and fulfill functional and social roles
in everyday life. Like most animals, humans are highly sensitive
to motion and subtle changes in movement. Existing research on
robotics suggests that a robot’s movements can not only perform
practical functions but also convey the robot’s purpose, intent, state,
character, attention, and capabilities [17].
While much of the research separates pragmatic robotics—such
as robotic arms performing household tasks—from social robotics,
like therapeutic robots providing emotional support, we argue that
any robot interacting with humans, even if designed primarily for
practical functions, embodies social value and should have its design
and behaviors shaped accordingly. For instance, in a collaborative
manipulation task with a human teammate, a robot should not only
consider functional actions, such as picking up and placing objects,
but also employ expressive movements that convey its intentions,
state, and even character traits. These expressive cues can help
human collaborators anticipate the robot’s actions, build trust, and
foster a sense of comfort and enjoyment in the collaborative process.
Our research addresses several questions: How do we design
expressive movements alongside functional actions for robots interacting with humans? What are the design spaces and movement
primitives? How do users perceive robots employing expressive
movements versus purely functional ones?
In this paper, we present our practice on designing an nonanthropomorphic robot in the form of a lamp, featuring a 6-DOF
arm and a head equipped with a light and a projector. As a common
household form factor, the lamp-like robot offers a rich design and
interaction space to engage with both the environment and users
through lights and movements—for example, directing a user’s
attention by illuminating specific spaces or objects.
We use research-through-design (RtD) [13] methodology to iterate the design of the robot’s form, movement, and interaction
scenarios. We formulate movement objectives with both functional
and expressive utilities - whereas functional utility brings the robot’s from initial to goal states within the physical and task space,

expressive utility emphasizes the trajectories taken to achieve these
goals. The latter incorporates considerations for expressing and
communicating the robot’s intention, attention, attitude, and emotional state to the user, as illustrated in figure 1. We elaborate the
building blocks for expressive movements with kinesics and proxemics primitives. Through video prototyping and storyboarding,
we demonstrate a range of use cases and task scenarios for the lamp
robot in home environments, organized along the dimensions of
robot agency and the social versus functional nature of tasks. Our
work aims to offer design inspiration and a framework for future
integration of expressive robots into daily life.
To evaluate the benefits of incorporating expressive movements
and comparing the outcome between expressive and functional
utilities, we conducted a user study comparing expression-driven
movements with function-driven movements across various task
scenarios. Participants (n=21) were tasked to watch human-robot
interaction videos in six different tasks, each with two robot variations. After each video, they evaluated the perception along the
metrics of engagement, intelligence, human-likeness, willingness
to interact, sense of connection, and robot character.
The results reveal that movements incorporating expressive
utilities significantly increased user ratings, compared to movements only driven by functions. Perceptions varied across tasks,
with expressive movements particularly benefiting social-oriented
tasks, such as entertainment and social conversations. Results also
suggested demographic effects from participants’ age and professional backgrounds. Qualitative analysis revealed additional insights into perceived robot characteristics and how users infer
the robot’s state from its movements, suggesting the potential to
customize these movements to individual preferences and align
them with other interaction modalities, including voice and light.
We hope the proposed framework and our study outcomes will
inspire future research on expressive movement generation for
non-anthropomorphic robots.

Related Work

In this section, we review related work in the domain of nonanthropomorphic robots for human-robot interactions, with an
emphasis on robot expression and movement-centric design. Additionally, we discussed related work from animation and character
design, which highly inspired this work.

2.1

Non-anthropomorphic Robots for HRI

The form and appearance of a robot impacts how people perceive
it, interact with it, and build long-term relationships with it [6].
Existing robotic form can be categorized with anthropomorphic
(human-like) [22], zoomorphic (animal-like), and appliance-like,
as illustrated in figure 2. While it is beneficial to have robots with
anthropomorphic design that have a positive impact on acceptance
[11], research also suggested that user preferences of robot forms
were task and context dependent [15]. The appearance of robots
should match its capabilities and user expectations.
Anthropomorphic robots use human-like gestures and expressions, such as body pose and facial expressions, mapped from
humans’ behaviors to convey a various of internal states. Nonanthropomorphic robots does not have an explicit vocabulary or

ELEGNT: Expressive and Functional Movement Design for Non-anthropomorphic Robot

mapping for expression. Existing research suggest multiple expressive channels for non-anthropomorphic robots, including movements [7, 17, 27, 32, 37], light/color [30, 33], sound [28], tactile
expression [8, 19, 20], and so on. For instance, Shimon [18], a musical improvisation robot, incorporates a socially expressive head
to communicate its internal states including rhythm, emotional
content, intensity, as well as manage turn-taking and attention
between the robot and human musicians, supporting joint musical attention. “The Greeting Machine” [3], embodies a small ball
rolling on a larger dome, designed to communicate positive and
negative social cues in the context of opening encounters. Existing
studies suggest that even abstract and simplistic movements, such
as Approach and Avoid, are effective in expressing robot intentions,
evoke positive and negative experiences of the users.
This work is highly inspired by the paper ”Designing Robots
with Movement in Mind” [17], which present technics of movement
centric design, including character sketches, video prototyping,
and Wizard of Oz studies. They illustrate the approach and design strategy with the design of non-anthropomorphic robots and
robotic objects. They suggest movements as robot dynamic affordance, which help cues users on potential actions and interactions
that the robot is capable of. The robot’s expressive movements
were considered early on in the design process, and may co-evolve
in the design iterations with robot hardware appearance and use
cases. Many recent research [14, 25] shift the robot design focus
from the production of life-like forms to the process of movement
and kinesthetic creation. It is important to consider the expressive
power of the robot’s movement - design movements that express
the robot’s purpose, intent, state, mood, personality, attention, responsiveness, intelligence, and capabilities [34]. In this work, we
take the idea of movement-centric design further with illustrated
movement designs grounded in real-world interaction scenarios
and conduct a user study to evaluate the effects of expressiondriven movements versus purely functional ones. Additionally, our
work follows the common practices of research-through-design approaches, combining artefact-centered research [9] and speculative
design explorations [2, 21].

2.2

Movement Design for Expression

Movement plays a fundamental role in how humans perceive and
interact with the world. Humans, like many animals, are highly
sensitive to motions [16]. Movements are essential in the coordination and performance of joint activities, serving to communicate
intentions and refer to objects of shared attention [10].
Insights into expressive movement design can be drawn from domains beyond robotics, such as animation, behavioral science, and
performing arts [31]. In these fields, movement is used as a medium
for communication, enabling objects, characters, and forms to convey emotions, intentions, and narratives. For example, in character
animation, abstract forms like dots, lines, and shapes are brought
to life through motion, timing, and staging. A classic example is the
animated short "The Dot and the Line" [24], where all expressions
are conveyed through motion with minimal visual elements. The
Pixar’s iconic animation "Luxo Jr." [23], also serves as the primary
inspiration of the lamp form, featuring two desk lamp characters,
demonstrating how simple movements can communicate narratives,

Zoomorphic, and Appliance-like.

relationships, and emotions. These works highlight the power of
motion, even with simple geometry, is effective in storytelling and
expression.
Research also shows that movements do not need to mimic human forms in detail to be perceived as intentional or expressive.
Humans are adept at interpreting the movements of abstract shapes,
as demonstrated by studies on point-light displays [29], where participants could classify activities and recognize individuals from
minimal visual cues. Beyond recognition, humans often attribute
internal states, characters, and intentions to abstract movements,
as exemplified by the Heider-Simmel Illusion [1], where simple geometric shapes moving in suggestive ways are perceived as having
purpose or personality. This phenomenon is closely tied to the Theory of Mind [5], which describes humans’ ability to infer mental
states and intentions from observed behaviors.
Drawing inspiration from animation principles and leveraging
humans’ innate sensitivity and projection to motion, we aim to
design and program physical robots with movements that effectively convey expressive and intentional behaviors. These principles
form the foundation of our work, combining the expressiveness
of motion with functional considerations to create engaging and
meaningful interactions.

Methodology

In this section, we outline the design process of a lamp-like robot,
developed by a team of HRI researchers, roboticists, and animators. Through iterative brainstorming, sketching, storyboarding,
and both hardware and software prototyping, we explored a range
of design considerations, including form selection, movement design, and potential use cases. Rather than providing an exhaustive
taxonomy of design spaces, our aim is to highlight key design opportunities and primitives that can inspire and guide future research
and practice.

with different form factors, sizes, and placements.

3.1

Designing Robot Form

There have been numerous explorations into home robots, such
as vacuum robots [38], table-top robotic assistants [35], robot pets
[12], and humanoids [26]. These robots often take on anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or appliance-like forms, as illustrated in
figure 2. Existing HRI research indicates that a robot’s form can
shape user expectations and influence interaction affordance. For
instance, users may expect a humanoid robot to interpret facial
expressions and gestures, whereas a vacuum robot might invite less
social engagement. Aligning a robot’s form with user expectations
and functional capabilities is a critical design consideration.
Inspired by the characters in “Luxo Jr.” [23], we adopt the form
factor of a desk lamp. Although primarily appliance-like, it incorporates subtle anthropomorphic elements—such as the lamp head and
the arm connecting the head to the stand—that evoke the appearance of a head and neck. The lamp’s light and camera can also be
mapped to robot “eyes”, providing a design opportunity to convey
the robot’s attention and purpose.
We consider aesthetic, expressive, and pragmatic aspects when
prototyping the hardware of the robot. From a pragmatic perspective, we aim for the robot to have a wide range of motion, allowing
it to cover a reasonable interaction space—for example, transitioning from illuminating a table to lighting up a couch. We explored
various placements and configurations for the lamp robot, including
ceiling-mounted, tabletop, and floor lamp designs, as illustrated in
Figure 3. While a floor lamp offers broader spatial coverage and

the potential for mobility, it also introduces challenges such as increased control complexity and a higher risk of physical collisions
during interactions. In contrast, ceiling-mounted lamps minimize
these risks but are limited in their interaction capabilities, as they
can only provide light from a top-down angle. Additionally, ceiling
robot movements are tend to be neglected during interactions since
they fall outside the user’s line of sight. Beyond spatial coverage,
we aim for the robot to use kinesthetic movements for expressive
purposes, such as nodding, shaking its head, or leaning forward and
backward. Therefore, the motors must be strategically positioned
to accommodate these motion ranges.
We also explored other non-anthropomorphic forms with similar range of motions, including designs inspired by a flower and a
giraffe, and abstract forms like sculptures and art pieces, as shown
in figure 3. While this paper focuses primarily on the tabletop lamp
integration, we envision that certain design principles may translate across different embodiments. For example, movement speed,
pauses, and proxemic relationships could be applied universally.
However, some design patterns, like a nodding gesture, may map
differently depending on the embodiment. In forms with a clear
head-neck relationship, the gesture might be immediately recognizable, whereas in more abstract forms, it could invite broader
interpretations.
Through iterative rapid prototyping, we integrate a robotic hardware platform for further testing and deployment, as illustrated in
figure 4 (left). The robot is composed of a re-purposed 6-DOF robotic
arm [36], a 3D-printed plastic lamp head with an embedded LED
light, a laser projector, and an internal camera, plus a downwardfacing external camera. Additionally, it is equipped with a voice
system to listen and speak to the user.

3.2

Generating Robot Movements

Existing research has shown that when communicating stories and
evoking emotions, movement often plays a more important role
than form. Characters and emotions can be conveyed through the
timing and quality of a movement. For example, the Heider-Simmel
Illusion [1] demonstrates that even simple geometric shapes can be
perceived as human figures if they appear to move on their own
accord. Humans naturally project character and metaphorical states
onto moving objects. By intentionally designing these movements,
we can instill character perceptions into robots, creating social
bonding and tolerance between robot and human, and make the
interactions more enjoyable.
3.2.1 Framework Formulation. To consider the problem of generating movements considering both functional and expressive
objectives, we present the high-level formulation of the problem
to guide the low-level trajectory design and integration. We mathematically formulate the robot movement problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) defined by a tuple (𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑃, 𝑅). At timestep
𝑡 ∈ 0, 1, . . . ,𝑇 , the state 𝑠𝑡 ∈ 𝑆 consists of the robot joint angles, the
tool states, and the environment states. For example, the tool states
would include turning the light on and off, as well as projecting
images. The environment states include the perceived state of the
users and other object of interests in the environment. The action
𝑎𝑡 ∈ 𝐴 consists of the change in joint angles and the tool event. The
transition function then defines 𝑠𝑡 +1 = 𝑃 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ). For simplicity, we

also denote the trajectory 𝜏 = (𝑠 0, 𝑠 1, . . . , 𝑠𝑇 ). The reward function
𝑅 consists of two parts: functional utility 𝐹 and expressive utility 𝐸.
Functional Utility 𝐹 defines the function-driven utility of reaching
certain states:
𝑇
∑︁
𝐹 (𝜏) =
𝑓 (𝑠𝑡 )
(1)
𝑡 =0

Without loss of generality, we assume there is only one goal state
𝑠𝑔 . In this case, 𝑓 (𝑠𝑡 ) = 1 (𝑠𝑡 = 𝑠𝑔 ) , where 1 (·) is the indicator
function.
Expressive Utility 𝐸 defines the expression-oriented utility of
reaching certain states:
𝐸 (𝜏) =

𝑇
∑︁

𝑒 (𝑠𝑡 )

(2)

𝑡 =0

In this work, we draw on design research methods to define 𝑒 (·)
along the expressive dimensions of attention, emotion, intention,
and attitudes, as discussed in Section 3.2.2.
Finally, the objective is to maximize the total utility:

the goal state, such as whether it moved to the desired position,
turned on the light, and projected the accurate information.
Expressive utility 𝐸, on the other hand, motivates the actions
aimed at communicating the robot’s traits, states, and intents to its
human interaction partners. For example, the robot may increase
expressive utility by looking toward a book before moving to it or
displaying curiosity through head tilts. Expressive utility can be
measured by users’ perceptions of the robot, including perceived
intelligence, intuitiveness, interaction quality, trust, engagement,
sense of connection, and willingness to use the robot. Drawing on
Theory of Mind (ToM)—the human cognitive ability to attribute
mental states such as beliefs, desires, emotions, and intentions
to others—we incorporate the following expression categories to
capture expressive utilities in the design of our expressive motion
library.

where 𝛾 is the weight for the expressive utility, which could vary
with different task and user. In Section 4, we present a user study to
evaluate the perception difference between the robot movements
when taking 𝛾 > 0 versus when 𝛾 = 0.

Intention. Intention refers to the purpose behind the robot’s actions and the anticipation of its upcoming movements. For instance,
when a robot extends its hand, the user can identify which object
the robot intends to pick up and what it plans to do with it, enabling
cooperation, supervision, or intervention as needed. In the case of
a lamp robot, it might briefly turn its head toward a target before
moving to reach or interact with it. This behavior signals the robot’s
intention, indicates a shift in attention, and cues the user about the
next action.

3.2.2 Functional and Expressive Utility. In the context of the lamp
robot, Functional utility 𝐹 drives motions that aim at achieving a
physical goal state, such as taking the initial state of user’s reading
activity or an explicit verbal request, the robot moves to face the
book and turns the light on, as well as projects assistive information
such as a visualization of a content in the book. The functional
utility is measured based on the level of completion of the task in

Attention. Attention refers to where the robot’s focus is directed,
with gaze serving as a strong indicator of that focus. For instance,
when a robot looks at an object, it may be analyzing it or preparing
for upcoming actions. In the context of a lamp robot—where camera
and light act as metaphoric “eyes”—we design gaze behaviors such
that looking toward the user can signal attention, for example when
the user is speaking. Similarly, a robot can exhibit joint attention by

gazing at or illuminating the same object or event as the user. For
example, while a user operates an object, the robot might watch
the user’s hand and the object being manipulated.
Attitude. Attitude refers to the robot’s stance toward a person,
object, or event. For instance, the robot may express agreement
or disagreement through motions such as nodding or shaking its
head. It can also convey attitudes or confidence in response to an
instruction or its own action by varying its movement profile—for
example, pausing to indicate hesitation or moving quickly and
decisively to show confidence.
Emotion. While robots do not experience emotions as humans do,
their ability to simulate emotional expressions is crucial for creating
intuitive, engaging interactions. For instance, a robot might use
light, bouncy movements to convey happiness, slow movements to
suggest a relaxed state, lower its head to indicate sadness, or employ
sudden, jerky motions to signal fear or other negative emotions.
3.2.3 Building Blocks: Expressive Movement Design Primitives. Through
a collaborative effort by animators and robot designers, we developed a design space with several primitives for creating expressive
motions, as illustrated in Figure 5. Drawing inspiration from human
and animal nonverbal behaviors, we designed motions to express
intention, attention, attitudes, and emotions. Similar to humans,

robots can use kinesics—expressive body movements—to communicate information and convey mental states or attitudes [4]. Kinesics encompass both spatial (pose-related) and temporal features
as design primitives. For spatial features, robots can incorporate
metaphorical gestures to represent various states. For instance, a
lamp-like robot with a head-and-neck configuration might nod
or shake its “head” to display attitudes, or lower it to convey sadness. The lamp’s long arm joint could also be imagined as a lower
body, enabling gestures like “tail wagging” to signify excitement
or “sitting down” to imply relaxation. For temporal features, robots
can adjust parameters such as speed, pauses, and acceleration (or
jerkiness) to communicate attitudes and emotions. For example,
adding pauses and jerky movements might suggest hesitation or a
lack of confidence. Varying movement speed can signal different
levels of emotional arousal: quick, sharp movements may indicate
high-arousal states like excitement or fear, while slower, smoother
motions might convey calmness or sadness.
Similar to humans, robots can use proxemics—the management
of spatial distance—to express their relationship with the environment and the people around them. This helps set expectations, establish communication channels, create boundaries, and signal context.
Proxemics in robots can involve both static and dynamic motion
primitives. For static primitives, robots could position themselves
relative to an object or person to convey attention and intention.
For example, directing their gaze at an object and using light or
projection to highlight it can signal focus or communicate context.
Pointing their “head” away from an object might suggest ignorance
or disinterest. Close proximity—such as touching an object—can
indicate affection or interest. For dynamic primitives, robots can
use movement to express attitudes or intentions. Approaching or
avoiding an object may reflect a robot’s stance toward it, while
shifting direction between objects or events can indicate changing
attention. Dynamic behaviors can also incorporate the use of light
accompanied with movements to guide user attention or emphasize
a point, such as for reminders or persuasive cues.
In sketching out this design space, we aimed to illustrate how
kinesics and proxemics can serve as motion primitives for generating robot expressions. Rather than offering an exhaustive list of
design parameters or options, this framework is intended to inspire
and guide further exploration and idea generation.

Interaction Scenarios

By design, the primary function of the lamp robot is to illuminate
spaces and support user activities. Equipped with a projector, the
robot can extend this functionality by creating in-situ projections
on walls, desks, and other surfaces. This capability enables the robot to project assistive information—either at the user’s request or
proactively—to remind or support ongoing activities. For instance,
it could project a tutorial video to guide a task or display a creative
drawing for inspiration. By projecting onto objects in the environment, the robot can also convey intention or offer contextual
information, such as displaying a water icon near a plant to remind
the user to water it.
We envision the lamp robot engaging in both social- and functionoriented tasks. Figure 6 illustrates some design outcomes of interaction scenarios and task designs through iterative storyboarding

(function-oriented vs. social-oriented).
and video prototyping. On the x-axis, we consider the primary goal
of the human-robot interaction. In function-oriented tasks, the
lamp robot serves as an assistant or tool—providing information
displays, offering desired lighting for user activities, adapting bedtime lighting, and reminding users of schedules or activities. In
contrast, social-oriented tasks position the lamp robot more like
a friend or pet, emphasizing companionship and entertainment.
Examples include suggesting creative ideas, introducing the room
to visitors, engaging in playful social interactions, playing music,
and projecting atmospheric lighting to enhance the overall user
experience.
The second dimension (y-axis) reflects the robot’s agency in
human-robot interaction, distinguishing between proactive and
reactive roles depending on the task. In robot-proactive tasks, the
robot initiates the interaction. Examples include sending reminders,
nudging the user to build habits, or offering creative suggestions. In
robot-reactive tasks, the robot responds to user requests or actions.
For instance, in a photography lighting task, the robot activates
the light based on the user’s verbal instructions and adjusts its
position in response to pointing gestures. Similarly, a sleep light
might switch on or off in response to the user’s movements or verbal
commands—activating a nightlight when asked or upon detecting
that the user has gotten out of bed.
To accommodate a wide range of tasks, the robot employs multiple modalities and activates different input/output channels and

skills according to the task requirements. A high-level task manager interprets the lamp’s initial placement, the environment, and
contextual information to determine and activate the appropriate
state spaces during initialization. Figure 4 (right) illustrates the various modalities the robot may respond to, including user activities
and instructive gestures, speech commands, and touch interactions.
The robot leverages torque sensing in its joints and can potentially
integrate touch sensors on its surface, enabling it to detect tactile
input and switch to compliant modes when needed.
Through the iterative design process, we selected six task scenarios for further implementation of function-driven and expressiondriven robot movements for a user study. This selection covers all
four sectors of the representative space, comprising three functionoriented and three social-oriented tasks, as detailed in Section 4.2.

User Study

Our research question is whether movements driven by expressive utility can enhance users’ perceptions of the robot and their
experience in human-robot interaction. To investigate this, we
compare two robot conditions: one employs only function-driven
movements (𝛾 = 0 in Equation 3), while the other incorporates
expression-driven movements in addition to function-driven ones,
achieving the same goal states but through different trajectories
(𝛾 > 0). Our objective is to determine whether—and to what extent—incorporating expression design into the robot’s movements

Conference DIS’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Madeira

influences user interaction outcomes, and how these effects may
vary according to the context of the tasks.

the limit, and look back at the user and shake head before sending
a verbal reaction.

4.1

Remind Water. Robot interrupts use activity and sends out a
reminder to drink a cup of water. F: Move to point toward the water
cup, light up, and send a verbal reminder; E: Move to the goal pose
described in F, push the cup toward the user, and gaze toward the
user before sending the verbal reminder.

Research Questions and Hypothesis

RQ1: To what extent does adding expression-driven movements,
in addition to function-driven movements, influence users’ perceptions of the robot?
H1: Users will perceive a robot that combines expression-driven
and function-driven movements as more engaging, human-like,
and intelligent than one solely incorporates function-driven movements.
RQ2: Does the task context affect movement preferences?
H2: Users’ perceptions will vary by task context—expressiondriven behaviors will be less favorable for function-oriented tasks
and more favorable for social-oriented tasks.

4.2

Method

We used a within-subject study design in which each participant
viewed videos of the robot completing six different tasks, presented
in a randomized order. After watching each video, participants
rated their perception of the robot and its interaction with the
human shown in the video. They were also encouraged to explain
the reasoning behind their ratings, providing insights into which
specific robot behaviors influenced their preferences.
To create the video demonstrations, a team of human-robot interaction researchers and animation designers iteratively designed
and refined pre-recorded robot movement trajectories using the design primitatives proposed in section 3.2.3. These trajectories were
then implemented using the off-the-shelf WidowX arm controller
to ensure smooth interactions. The videos used in this study are
included in the supplementary materials.
We designed and implemented six scenarios, each presented in
two conditions:
F: A robot with function-driven movements only.
E: A robot with both function-driven and expression-driven
movements.
Details of the six task scenarios and robot movement description
are provided below.
Photograph Light. Robot responds to user’s hand gestures to
move and offer desired lighting conditions for photography. F: Move
in response to user gesture and object position; E: Move to express
the curiosity toward the object by leaning forward, movements
incorporating robot’s attention to user command by looking back
toward the user when detecting an instructive gesture.
Project Assistance. Robot observes user task and provides a corresponding video projection to guide the task. F: Move to a target position for projection, and project a corresponding video; E:
Show curiosity toward the user activity and display joint attention
through gaze direction.
Failure Indication. User instructs a goal position for the robot
which is out of reach, the robot displays the error message back to
the user. F: Attempt to move toward the goal direction, reach the
limit, and verbally output the error; E: Pause to display hesitation
before moving, stretch the body to display efforts when reaching

Social Conversation. Robot takes the role as a social companion,
engages with the user in a social conversation about daily activities. F: Respond to user’s speech verbally; E: Use movements as
nonverbal cues in accordance with verbal texts, including gazing
at the user, pointing to refer to the object in context of speech, use
kinesthetic gestures to display emotions of excitement (dancing
movement) and sadness (lowering the head).
Play Music. Robot plays music entertainment accompanying
user’s daily activities. F: Play music with no movement; E: Play music while perform dance movements, align the movement rhythm
with music tempo.

4.3

Measure

We include six dimension of quantitative metrics to measure the
perception toward the robot (human-likeliness, perceived intelligence, perceived emotion/character), the quality of the interaction
(interaction engagement, the sense of connection), and willingness
to use the robot in real life. Specifically, participants rate their perception on a scale from 0 to 100 to indicate their agreement to
six statements, measuring the above-mentioned aspects. Besides,
we collected demographic data of participants including their gender, age, background regarding robotics, background regarding
expression design (such as performing arts, psychology, animation,
communication), general level of empathy (“I find it easy to express
empathy and understanding towards others.), general acceptance
toward robot (“I feel comfortable interacting with a robotic companion”). After each video, we collect qualitative feedback of the video
by asking “how would you describe the robot in the video? What do
you like or dislike about the robot?” This allow us to gather insights
on participants reasoning of their choices and explore open-ended
ideas on the perception that we did not cover in the quantitative
metrics.

4.4

Participants

We recruited 30 participants using emails and announcements distributed within the organization1 . Responses were filtered based
on the time taken to complete the task, excluding those that took
less than ten minutes, as well as any incomplete responses. This
process resulted in 21 valid participants (𝑁 = 21). Among them,
eight are female, twelve are male, and one participant did not disclose their gender. The participants’ ages range from 26 to 51 years.
In terms of ethnicity, ten participants self-identified as Asian, nine
self-identified as White or Caucasian, and two preferred not to
disclose their ethnicity.

robot movements across six different task scenarios.

Results

This section presents the results through both quantitative and
qualitative lens to uncover the perception differences between the
two robot conditions across different tasks.

5.1

Quantitative Results

To test H1, we compared the average ratings across different metrics between the two robot conditions, averaged across different
tasks. The robots with expression-driven movements are rated
much higher (𝑀 = 56.16, 𝑠𝑡𝑑 = 27.15) than robots incorporating only function-driven movements (𝑀 = 28.77, 𝑠𝑡𝑑 = 27.15).
Welch’s t-test revealed a statistical significance in the difference,
𝑡 = 19.85, 𝑝 < 0.0001. The biggest difference lies in the metrics
of Perceived character (𝑡 = 10.58), followed by Human-likeliness
(𝑡 = 9.32), Engagement (𝑡 = 8.80), Sense of Connection (𝑡 = 8.50),
then Willingness to Interact (𝑡 = 7.37), and Perceived Intelligence
(𝑡 = 5.22), 𝑝 < 0.001 for all of the individual metric, which indicate
statistical significance in the differences. Thus, H1 is supported.
Figure 7 depicts the average ratings (from 0 to 100, the higher,
the better) for expression-driven robots (blue) and function-driven
robots (pink) across various tasks and evaluation metrics. The xaxis represents different tasks, arranged based on the purpose of the
task—ranging from function-oriented tasks, such as photography
lighting, projecting information, or displaying error messages, to
socially-oriented tasks, such as music entertainment, social conversation, and habit nudging. The results reveal that expression-driven
robots (blue) outperform function-driven robots (pink) across most
of the tasks. The trend indicates that for social-oriented tasks
(toward the right side of the x-axis), expression-driven robots are

perceived significantly better compared to function-oriented
tasks (toward the left side).
To further investigate these differences, we conducted statistical tests (Welch’s t-test) for each task and metric to compare the
expression-driven and function-driven robot movements. The resulting p-values are displayed in Figure 8, where the dark color
indicates statistical significance (𝑝 < 0.05). The table shows that
for social-oriented tasks (play music, conversation, remind water),
expression-driven robots significantly outperform function-driven
robots across all metrics. However, for function-oriented tasks (photograph light, project assistance, failure indication), the two robots
show no significant differences in metrics such as Perceived intelligence, Willingness to interact, and Engagement. Thus, H2 is
supported.
To understand the effect of participants’ backgrounds on their
perception of robots, we conducted a linear regression analysis to

Conference DIS’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Madeira

Figure 9: Effect of participants’ demographics and backgrounds on average perception ratings
examine the correlations between perception metrics (average ratings of perception) and background variables, including gender, age,
general level of empathy, general acceptance of robots, backgrounds
related to robotics and character design, as shown in Figure 9. Our
findings indicate that age significantly influenced perceptions of expressive robots, with older participants showing less preference for
expressive robots (𝑝 < 0.001). Additionally, we observed a trend in
empathy levels affecting perception differences between functional
and expressive robots: participants with self-rated low empathy
perceived a stronger increase in robot likability after the integration
of expressive movements. In contrast, participants who self-rated
as having high empathy were less influenced by the integration of
expressive movement in the robot. We also found a positive correlation between robot acceptance and perception scores. However,
these correlations did not reach statistical significance. Besides, we
conducted t-tests to compare the perception difference between
gender groups, robotic backgrounds, and groups who have or do
not have backgrounds related to character and expression design,
including animation, psychology, performing arts, etc. Gender did
not have a significant impact on perception (𝑝 = 0.2). Robotic background is a significant predictor of perception, with non-roboticist
rating robots higher than roboticist (𝑝 = 0.006). Background related
to expressive character design is another strong predictor, with
experienced character designers and artists rating robots significantly lower than others. For all the groups above, they rated the
expressive robots higher than the functional ones.

matching her energy, dancing bigger because she was dancing bigger.
It makes me want to join. There is such power in the synergy!” (P12)
In the qualitative reasoning, participants attributed the robot with
expressive movements characteristics of human or pets, with its
own drives and needs. Many participants said the expressive robot
remind them of a “puppy” or “child” . In the failure indication
scenario, P12 described the expressive robot has “a resilient spirit”.
In the playing music scenario, P1 said “it looks like it’s having fun.”
On the contrary, participants found it difficult to attribute human
characteristics in robots with little movement and described the
robot as a “tool” or compared it to existing home devices. Participants commented the robot with only functional movements as
“boring”, “too machine-like”, “not engaging”, “emotionless”, and may
arouse negative feelings, especially during social conversations
and playing music scenarios. P3 is confused about its motivation
of asking a social-oriented question during the conversation, as
they assumed the robot did not have its own needs or emotions.
P7 also commented that the robot looked “kinda creepy as if it
was intently staring” during the social conversation due to little
movements. Participants also noted the unnaturalness and lack
of social connection with only functional movements. During the
scenario of reminding human to drink water, P1 commented that
“It [the functional robot] does not seem to care whether or not the
human drinks the water.” P15 mentioned that without the robot
“looking at the user like how humans engage with each other, there
was a lack of connection.”

Qualitative Results

We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of participants’ feedback on individual robot behaviors to gain deeper insights into the
reasoning behind their ratings. We identify the perception reasoning behind expressive and functional movements, as well as the
interaction with task context and other interaction modalities, as
visualized in figure 10.
5.2.1 Perception of Robot Characteristics. Participants commented the robot with expressive movements as more engaging,
lively, harmless, embodied a “sense of humor”, and were “fun to
watch”. P4 noted that the expressive robot showed more information of robot internal states, such as emotions, which weren’t
apparent in function-driven only movements. Several participants
said the expressive motions were affective throughout the interaction of robot playing music and dancing: “... that appeared to be

5.2.2 Inference of Robot State. Participants perceived and discussed the robot’s intention, attention, attitudes and emotion behind the expressive movements in the questionnaires. For instance,
in the social conversation scenario, P1 mapped the robot’s movement toward the window as if “checking the weather outside” [intention],
and the moving around as excitement, hanging its head as sadness
[emotions]. During the projection task, P14 perceived the leaning
forward and tilting head movement as robot’s displaying curiosity, saying “The robot first seems to be interested in the human task
[attitude]. I liked that. It seems to be happy to help.” In the task of
photograph light, the expressive robot tilts the head back toward
the the human when the human gestures. Several participants were
able to perceive it as the robot paying attention to the human
instruction. P7 said, “I liked when it looked at the person for feedback,
as if saying "is this good?" ”

ELEGNT: Expressive and Functional Movement Design for Non-anthropomorphic Robot

Conference DIS’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Madeira

Figure 10: Summary of qualitative results - clusters and implications.
Even for robots with only functional movements, some participants still perceive the robot’s movement with theory of mind,
such as projecting robot’s attention and intention. For example,
during the task of failure indication, the robot stretches its arm
toward the note before displaying the failure message, participants
interpreted the stretch as “the robot seemed to struggle” (P6). P7 also
noted that the robot’s facing direction clearly indicated its attention:
“the robot and the person are looking at the same note”.
5.2.3 What expressive movements were valued and what
were not. While adding expressive movements proved to benefit
the interactions, some participants found them unnecessary and
inefficient. P15 noted for the failure indication task “... there needs
to be a balance between engagement through motion and speed completion of the task being given, otherwise the human might grow
impatient. It might be OK the first time with the novelty factor but
will quickly fade out.” While some participants enjoyed the expressive motions, others noted that some expressive behaviors could be
too exaggerated, thus distracting or disturbing. Some participants
mentioned they disliked the robot to move all the time, especially
the movement for no apparent reasons, which may imply “a lack
of attention on the robot’s part” (P5, conversation) Most participants
appreciated the information that were “quick and easy to interpret”, while for the subtle movements, participants had different
preferences.
Participants reported negative perception when there was a mismatch between robot’s movement and its perceived capabilities.
For the failure indication function, P14 noted that “I did not like
that it tried to get momentum with an impulse as it seems fake.” P20
thought the robot did not have a camera on the head thus the
“looking at notes” action seemed fake.

The preferences of adding expressive movements vary across
tasks. For tasks that include little functional movements, and for
tasks that were social-oriented and less sensitive to efficiency, expressive movements were more appreciated. For instance, in the
scenario of playing music for entertainment, P21 noted that “I really
liked this application for robot engagement! No fast responses were
necessary, so having an engaging dancing motion made the robot more
engaging. ” On the other hand, for the tasks that inherently have
clear function-driven movements and are more function-oriented,
adding expressive movements could be confusing to some individuals and preferences vary. For instance, in the scenario of photograph
light, participants thought the expressive movements made the robot seem less “predictable”(P5), less “steady”(P14). P18 wished the
robot to “stick to only the task relevant motion which is angle and
the light”. Even without expressive movements, in such functionoriented tasks, participants rated highly of the robots as long as the
robot were able to move in correspondence to the context and user
request.
It is important to note that many participants were less acceptable to robot taking proactive roles than reactive roles, such as
reminding the user to drink water. For instance, P20 noted that “...
I don’t like my life to be controlled by a robot. If I’m in the middle
of some exciting readings, I don’t want to be disrupted by a robot’s
command.” Adding the expressive movements such as with a playful character could increase the acceptance of robot behavior, P8
noted that “Without the playfulness, I might find this type of
interaction with a robot annoying rather than welcome and
engaging.”
5.2.4 The effect of voice and light. Participants repeatedly commented on the alignment between movements and other modalities,
such as the robot’s sound and light. Several participants felt there

Conference DIS’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Madeira

was a mismatch between robot’s speech cadence and the expressive motions - while the expressive motions were “endearing,
showing a character”, the tone from the robot was very “automated”,
“stiff”, and “took away from how friendly the interaction felt”. P7 and
P15 noted that the timing of the voice need to align with the
timing of the movement, to make it feel more natural. P12 found
the sound from the motors disturbing, and may only “punctuate
with smaller slower movements”.
The coordination between movement and lighting can influence
the comfort of interaction. Some participants mentioned preferring
the robot to remain steady while maintaining the light. In such
cases, expressive movements might interfere with the primary lighting function, as the robot’s motion could distract when displaying
attention or curiosity. Additionally, the proximity of the light also
impacted perceptions of disruption, as noted by P21. P7 appreciated
that “the robot turned out its light when looking at the person” during
assistive projection.

Discussion

In this paper, we conducted design research to explore how adding
expressive movements on top of purely functional ones affects
human-robot interactions. Both quantitative and qualitative findings show that expressive movements, compared to strictly functional ones, enhance the overall interaction experience and improve
perceived robot qualities. Participants were more likely to recognize
the robot’s state of mind, projecting intentions, attention, emotions,
and attitudes throughout their interactions. For instance, participants recognized the robot’s “gaze” as a marker of joint attention,
suggesting a stronger bond between human and robot. Additionally, participants more frequently described the expressive robot
as a living being—for example, a “pet,” a “child,” or a “friend.” In
some tasks, adding expressive movements made the experience
more engaging and playful. In particular, when the robot initiated
an interaction or nudged participants, its expressive movements
made those interruptions feel more acceptable, such as in the case
of interrupting the user during the reading and nudging the user
to drink water. This may be due to that participants possess more
empathy towards the robot with expressive movements, as they
remind them of living beings, just like the pets making the mess
in the home; and thus the initially disturbing behaviors transfer
into a playful social interaction. This highlighted the benefit of
adding expressive and characterful motions for robot-initiated task
scenarios.
The quantitative results reveal differences in perception across
various tasks. For social-oriented tasks—such as playing music,
engaging in social conversations, and nudging water—adding expressive movements was significantly more preferred. The qualitative reasoning further illuminates this trend: in these tasks, users
prioritize engagement and entertainment over task efficiency. Consequently, adding expressive movements enhances the robot’s playfulness and character. Moreover, social-oriented tasks in the study
generally entail minimal function-driven motions. For instance,
when playing music or holding social conversations, the robot primarily responds verbally, and the functional output does not involve
any physical movement. In these contexts, incorporating expressive
movements aligned with the social and task setting enriches the

interaction, increases user engagement, and can even convey an
additional layer of information. On the other hand, for tasks that
are function-driven—such as adjusting lighting angles or shifting
between projection spaces—adding expressive motions can disrupt
the robot’s primary function and potentially cause confusion or annoyance for users. This implies that expression-driven movements
need to complement function-driven movements by adjusting both
the amount and timing of expressions to enrich—rather than conflict with—the original motions. Future research should balance the
trade-off between task efficiency and characterfulness in humanrobot interaction, while also considering individual preferences
through personalized behaviors. For instance, although some users
enjoyed a more animated robot, others disliked constant movement,
particularly when it occurred without a clear or explicit reason.
The design and integration of expressive motions also need to
align with the robot’s embodiment and capabilities. For instance,
gaze behaviors should be co-designed with the placement of the
robot’s “eyes” (cameras) and “head”. While this may be intuitive
for humanoid robots, robots with non-anthropomorphic features
rely on appearance design and movement patterns to suggest a lifelike embodiment that can be intuitive to humans and even other
species. It is equally important to match these movements with
the robot’s other modalities—in this case, its voice and the lamp’s
light or display. As many participants noted, the speech content,
tone, and timing during movement sequences all play a key role
in shaping the perceived quality of the robot’s behaviors. Future
research needs to consider more extensive alignment among these
different modalities to further enhance human-robot interaction.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present ELEGNT, a framework for designing
expressive and functional movements for non-anthropomorphic
robots in daily interactions. The framework integrates functiondriven and expression-driven utilities, where the former focuses
on finding an optimal path to achieve a physical goal state, and
the latter motivates the robot to take paths that convey its internal
states—such as intention, attention, attitude, and emotion—during
human-robot interactions. We use a lamp-shaped robot to illustrate the design space for functional and expressive movements in
various interaction scenarios, ranging from function-oriented to
social-oriented tasks, and involving reactive versus proactive robot
roles. We conduct a user study to compare perceptions of the robot
when using expressive movements versus only functional movements across six different task scenarios. Our results indicate that
incorporating expressive movements significantly increases user
likability toward the robot and enhances interaction engagement.
The perception varies across tasks, with social-oriented tasks that
require minimal function-driven movements benefiting particularly
from the addition of expression-driven movements. Qualitative
analysis further elaborates on users’ differing perceptions of the
robot’s characteristics and the perceived robots’ mental models.
The findings also highlight the importance of aligning movement
with other robot modalities, such as voice and light. Future work
will integrate these design insights into a generative framework for
creating context-aware robotic movements that effectively express
intentions in non-anthropomorphic robots.

Vision-Language-Action Models

Abstract

inputs, corrections, and feedback. Achieving this kind of
flexibility is essential for robots in open-ended, humancentric environments. For instance, consider a robot tasked
with tidying up a table after a meal: instead of rigidly following a single predefined set of steps, the robot would
need to interpret dynamic prompts like “only take away
someone’s dishes if they are done eating,” respond to corrections like “leave it alone,” and adapt when faced with unfamiliar challenges, such as a delicate object that requires
special handling. This paper aims to advance robotic intelligence by enabling robots to interpret and act on diverse
natural language commands, feedback, and corrections – a
step towards creating agents that reason through tasks, integrate human feedback seamlessly, and operate with humanlike adaptability. If we can enable a robot to process and
engage with complex natural language interaction, we can
unlock not only better instruction following, but also the
ability for users to guide a robot through new tasks and
correct the robot in real time.

Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world settings must be able
to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish their goals, but also process complex
instructions, prompts, and even feedback during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g.,
“Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?”
or “I don’t like that one”) require not just the
ability to physically perform the individual steps,
but the ability to situate complex commands and
feedback in the physical world. In this work, we
describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over
complex prompts and user feedback to deduce
the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task,
and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following
methods that can fulfill simple commands (“pick
up the cup”), our system can reason through
complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution (“that’s not trash”).
We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dualarm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to
handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.

Achieving this level of flexibility and steerability in
robotic systems is challenging. While standard languageconditioned imitation learning can follow simple, atomic
instructions such as “pick up the coke can” (Brohan et al.,
2022), real-world tasks are rarely so straightforward. Imagine a more realistic prompt, such as: “Could you make
me a vegetarian sandwich? I’d prefer it without tomatoes.
Also, if you have ham or roast beef, could you make a separate sandwich with one of those for my friend?” This requires not only understanding the language, but also the
ability to situate commands within the current context and
compose existing skills (e.g., picking up the roast beef)
to solve a new task. If the robot further receives corrections and feedback (“that’s not how you do it, you have
to get lower, otherwise you’ll keep missing”), these must
also be integrated dynamically into task execution. This
challenge resembles the distinction between Kahneman’s
“System 1” and “System 2” cognitive processes (Kahneman, 2011). The “automatic” System 1 corresponds to a
policy capable of executing straightforward commands by
triggering pre-learned skills, while the more deliberative

and constraints, complete unseen long-horizon tasks, and respond verbally when needed.

ing grounding in the robot’s capabilities.

System 2 involves higher-level reasoning to parse complex
long-horizon tasks, interpret feedback, and decide on an appropriate course of action. Prior work in robotic instruction
following has largely focused on atomic instructions (Stepputtis et al., 2020; Jang et al., 2022; Brohan et al., 2022),
addressing only System 1-level behaviors.

The main contribution of our paper is a hierarchical
interactive robot learning system (Hi Robot), a novel
framework that uses VLMs for both high-level reasoning
and low-level task execution. We show that our framework
enables a robot to process much more complex prompts
than prior end-to-end instruction following systems and incorporate feedback during task execution (Figure 1). While
some of the individual components of this system, such as
the low-level VLA policy, have been studied in prior work,
the combination of these components along with our synthetic data generation scheme are novel and enable novel
capabilities. We evaluate Hi Robot on diverse robots, including single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile platforms. Our
evaluation requires the robots to perform a variety of tasks,
including new combinations of skills seen during training,
in the context of scenarios that span cleaning of messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping. Our experiments show that Hi Robot surpasses multiple prior approaches, including using API-based VLMs and flat VLA
policies, in both alignment with human intent and task success. By grounding high-level reasoning in both verbal and
physical interaction, Hi Robot paves the way for more intuitive and steerable human-robot symbiosis, advancing the
potential for flexible intelligence in real-world applications.

In this paper, we address the more intricate reasoning
needed for complex prompts and feedback by introducing a
hierarchical reasoning system for robotic control based on
vision-language models (VLMs). In our system, the robot
incorporates complex prompts and language feedback using a VLM, which is tasked with interpreting the current
observations and user utterances, and generating suitable
verbal responses and atomic commands (e.g., “grasp the
cup”) to pass into the low-level policy for execution. This
low-level policy is itself a vision-language model finetuned
for producing robotic actions, also known as a visionlanguage-action (VLA) model (Black et al., 2024; Brohan
et al., 2023a; Kim et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2024). We
expect that robot demonstrations annotated with atomic
commands will not be sufficient for training the high-level
model to follow complex, open-ended prompts, and we
therefore need representative examples of complex prompt
following. To acquire this data, we propose to synthetically
label datasets consisting of robot observations and actions
with hypothetical prompts and human interjections that
might have been plausible for that situation. To this end,
we provide a state-of-the-art vision-language model with a
robot observation and target atomic command, and ask it
to come up with a prompt or human interaction that may
have preceded that observation and command, i.e. generating high-level policy prompts for different outcomes. By
incorporating these synthetically-generated but situated examples into high-level policy training, our approach generalizes to diverse prompts and interjections while maintain-

2. Related Work
Our work relates to research on VLMs for robotic control,
which we can categorize into two groups: directly training
VLMs for robotic control and using VLMs out-of-the-box
with pre-defined robot skills. In the former category, methods fine-tune VLMs to output robotic controls based on input images and language commands (Brohan et al., 2023a;
Wen et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Black et al., 2024; Liu

et al., 2024c; Li et al., 2024; O’Neill et al., 2024; Zawalski et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2025; Pertsch et al., 2025) .
While such methods have demonstrated impressive generalization and instruction-following, they are trained for relatively simple commands (“put the cup on the plate”). In
contrast, we demonstrate tasks with intricate prompts and
human interactions that require situated reasoning.

a new data generation scheme to enable diverse prompts
and open-ended corrections. Finally, RACER (Dai et al.,
2024) can also incorporate situated corrections, but relies
on a physics simulator to construct recovery behaviors; our
approach only uses real robot demonstrations without intentional perturbations or corrections and is applicable to
open-ended prompts.

In the latter category, a number of methods use LLMs and
VLMs to reason over robot observations and commands,
and break up multi-stage tasks into simpler steps that can
be performed by low-level controllers. Earlier methods of
this sort used language models in combination with various
learned or hand-designed skills (Huang et al., 2022; Brohan
et al., 2023b; Liang et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2024; Singh
et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024), but such systems have limited ability to incorporate complex context, such as image
observations, into the reasoning process. More recently,
multiple works have use VLMs to output parameters for
pre-defined robotic skills (Huang et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2024a; Nasiriany et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Liu et al.,
2024b; Stone et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2024; Zhi et al., 2024).
Such methods can process more complex commands and
situate them in the context of visual observations, but these
approaches have shown limited physical dexterity and limited ability to incorporate real-time language interaction
with humans (with some exceptions discussed below). In
contrast, our system utilizes VLMs for both high-level reasoning and low-level control, with a flexible language interface between the two. These design choices, along with
a new synthetic data generation scheme, allow our system
to achieve both significant physical dexterity and detailed
promptability that prior works lack.

3. Preliminaries and Problem Statement
A learned policy controls a robot by processing observation
inputs, which we denote ot , and producing one or more actions At = [at , at+1 , ..., at+H−1 ], where we use At to
denote an action chunk consisting of the next H actions to
execute (Zhao et al., 2023). Our system takes as input the
images from multiple cameras I1t , ..., Int , the robot’s configuration (i.e., joint and gripper positions) qt , and a language prompt ℓt . Thus, we have ot = [I1t , ..., Int , ℓt , qt ],
and the policy represents the distribution p(At |ot ). Prior
works have proposed various methods for representing and
training such policies (Zhao et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023;
Octo Model Team et al., 2024; Pertsch et al., 2025).
Since our focus will be specifically on complex, multi-stage
tasks that require parsing intricate prompts and even dynamic user feedback, we need our policies to be able to
interpret complex language and ground it via observations
of the environment. A particularly powerful approach for
handling such complex semantics is provided by visionlanguage-action (VLA) models (Black et al., 2024; Brohan
et al., 2023a; Kim et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2024), which
use vision-language model (VLM) pre-training to initialize the policy p(At |ot ). A VLM is a language model
that has also been trained to process image inputs, and
represents a distribution p(ℓ′ |I, ℓ) – the probability of a
language suffix ℓ′ (e.g., an answer to a question) in response to an image-language prefix consisting of an image I and a prompt ℓ (e.g., a visual question). The most
commonly used VLMs represent p(ℓ′ |I, ℓ) via an autoregressive decoder-only Transformer model, factorizing the
distribution into a product of autoregressive token probabilities p(xt+1 |x1 , ..., xt , I), where xt denotes the tth token
(not to be confused with a physical time step), and we have
ℓ = [x1 , ..., xtp ] and ℓ′ = [xtp +1 , ..., xtp +ts ], with tp the
length of the prefix and ts the length of the suffix (Beyer
et al., 2024). We also use such Transformer-based VLMs,
but since we do not modify their architecture and their autoregressive structure is therefore not relevant to our discussion, we will use the more concise p(ℓ′ |I, ℓ) notation to
represent a standard VLM.

Many works aim to enable robotic language interaction
with users, including model-based systems that parse language instructions and feedback and ground them via a
symbolic representation of the scene (Swadzba et al., 2009;
Matuszek et al., 2013; Namasivayam et al., 2023; Patki
et al., 2019), and more recent learning-based methods that
process feedback directly, typically with a hierarchical architecture (Liu et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2024; Shi et al.,
2024; Belkhale et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2024; McCallum
et al.; Driess et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2024). Our work builds
on the latter class of methods, where user feedback is incorporated via a high-level policy that provides atomic commands to a learned low-level policy. Unlike OLAF (Liu
et al., 2023), which uses an LLM to modify robot trajectories, our approach can incorporate situated corrections
based on the robot’s observations, respond to those corrections in real time, and follow complex prompts describing dexterous manipulation tasks. While YAY Robot (Shi
et al., 2024) can handle situated real-time corrections, it
is limited to one prompt and to the corrections seen in
the human-written data; our approach leverages VLMs and

A standard VLA is produced by fine-tuning the VLM
p(ℓ′ |I, ℓ) such that the actions At are represented by tokens
in the suffix ℓ′ , typically by tokenizing the actions via discretization. We build on the π0 VLA (Black et al., 2024),

except that the language command ℓt is replaced by the
output from the high-level policy ℓ̂t . Thus, following the
System 1/System 2 analogy, the job of the high-level policy is to take in the overall task prompt ℓt and accompanying context, in the form of images and user interactions,
and translate it into a suitable task for the robot to do at
this moment, represented by ℓ̂t , that the low-level policy
is likely to understand. Of course, for simple and familiar
tasks, this is not necessary – if we simply want the robot to
perform a task that the low-level policy was directly trained
for, we could simply set ℓ̂t = ℓt and proceed as in prior
work (Brohan et al., 2022). The benefit of this hierarchical
inference process is in situations where either the prompt ℓt
is too complex for the low-level policy to parse, too unfamiliar in the context of the robot data, or involves intricate
interactions with the user.

Figure 2: Overview of hierarchical VLA. The policy consists
of a high-level and a low-level policy. The high-level policy processes open-ended instructions and images from base and wristmounted cameras to generate low-level language commands. The
low-level policy uses these commands, images, and robot states
to produce actions and optionally verbal responses.

The high-level policy is represented by a VLM that uses the
images and ℓt as the prefix, and produces ℓ̂t as the suffix.
We describe how this model is trained in Section 4.3.
Since high-level inference is slower but also less sensitive
to quick changes in the environment, we can comfortably
run it at a lower frequency. A variety of strategies could
be used to instantiate this, including intelligent strategies
where the system detects when the command ℓ̂t has been
completed before inferring the next suitable command. In
our implementation, we found a very simple strategy to
work well: we rerun high-level inference and recompute
ℓ̂t either when one second has elapsed, or when a new interaction with the user takes place. This provides reactive
behavior when the user provides feedback or corrections,
while maintaining simplicity.

which additionally handles multiple images and continuous
state observations qt , and modifies the VLM to output continuous action chunk distributions via flow-matching, but
the high-level principles are similar. While such VLA models can follow a wide variety of language prompts (Brohan
et al., 2023a), by themselves they are typically limited to
simple and atomic commands, and do not handle the complex prompts and feedback that we study in this paper.

4. Hi Robot
We provide an overview of our method in Figure 2. Our
approach decomposes the policy p(At |ot ) into a low-level
and high-level inference process, where the low-level policy consists of a VLA that produces the action chunk At
in response to a simpler, low-level language command, and
the high-level policy consists of a VLM that processes the
open-ended task prompt, and outputs these low-level language commands for the low-level inference process. The
two processes run at different rates: the low-level process
produces action chunks at a high frequency, while the highlevel process is invoked less often, either after a set time or
upon receiving new language feedback. Thus, the highlevel process essentially “talks” to the low-level process,
breaking down complex prompts and interactions into bitesized commands that can be converted into actions.

4.2. Incorporating User Interaction
The user can intervene at any point during policy execution
and provide additional information and feedback, or even
change the task entirely. In our prototype, these interventions take the form of text commands or spoken language
(which is then transcribed into text). When the system receives a user intervention, the high-level inference is triggered immediately to recompute ℓ̂t . The high-level policy
has the option to include a verbal utterance ut in the command ℓ̂t , which can be confirmations or clarifications from
the robot. When ut is included, we use a text to speech
system to play the utterance to the user, and remove it from
ℓ̂t before passing it into the low-level policy.
When an interjection (“leave it alone”) has been fulfilled,
the user can signal to the robot that it may switch back
to the previous command and continue the task execution.
Notably, the responses of the high-level policy are contextual, because it observes not only the prompt ℓt , but also
the current image observations. Therefore, it can correctly
ground feedback like “that’s not trash,” which is not possi-

4.1. Hierarchical Inference with VLAs
Formally, the high-level policy phi (ℓ̂t |I1t , ..., Int , ℓt ) takes in
the image observations and an open-ended prompt ℓt , and
produces an intermediate language command ℓ̂t . The lowlevel policy plo (At |I1t , ..., Int , ℓ̂t , qt ) takes in the same type
of observation as the standard VLA described in Section 3,

HIGH-LEVEL POLICY
TRAINING

In our implementation, the low-level and high-level policies use the same base VLM as a starting point, namely
the PaliGemma-3B VLM (Beyer et al., 2024). The lowlevel policy is the π0 VLA (Black et al., 2024), which
is trained by finetuning PaliGemma-3B with an additional
flow matching “action expert” to produce continuous actions, while the high-level policy is fine-tuned on the
image-language tuples described in Section 4.3 to predict
commands. While we employ π0 for our experiments, our
framework is inherently modular, allowing for the integration of alternative language-conditioned policies as needed.

Figure 3: Data collection and generation for training the highlevel policy. We first collect teleoperated robot demonstrations
and segment them into short skills (e.g., pick up KitKat). Using
this labeled data, we prompt a vision-language model (VLM) to
generate synthetic user instructions (e.g., “Can you get me something sweet?”) and robot responses. The resulting dataset is used
to train the high-level policy, which maps image observations and
user commands to verbal responses and skill labels.

5. Experiments
In our experimental evaluation, we study a range of problems that combine challenging physical interactions with
complex user interaction, including multi-stage instructions, live user feedback in the middle of the task, and
prompts that describe novel task variations. We compare
our full method to prior approaches and to alternative designs that use other high-level policy training methods. The
aims of our experiments are:

ble with language-only systems.
4.3. Data Collection and Training Hi Robot

1. Evaluate the ability of our method to follow a variety of
complex textual prompts and live user feedback.
2. Compare our full method to prior approaches that train
a flat instruction-following VLA policy or that use foundation models out-of-the-box for high-level reasoning.
3. Evaluate the importance of synthetic data and hierarchy
for task performance and language following.

To train Hi Robot in a scalable manner, we employ
both human-labeled and synthetically generated interaction
data, as illustrated in Figure 3. First, we collect robot
demonstration data Ddemo via teleoperation. This yields
trajectories with coarse language annotations of the overall goal (e.g., make a sandwich). We then segment these
full demonstration episodes into short skills, ℓ̂t , such as
pick up one piece of lettuce, which generally last between
one and three seconds. We also heuristically extract basic movement primitives (e.g., small corrective motions)
such as move the right arm to the left from the raw robot
actions. The resulting dataset Dlabeled contains a set of
(ℓ̂t , I1t , ..., Int ) tuples that describe robot skills.

5.1. Tasks and Baseline Methods
We use three complex problem domains in our experiments, as shown in Figure 4.
Table bussing involves cleaning up a table, placing dishes
and utensils into a bussing bin and trash items into the trash.
The training data consists of full table cleaning episodes.
This task is physically challenging because some items require nuanced grasping strategies (e.g., grasping a plate by
the edge), the robot must pick up and singulate different
objects, and in some cases might even manipulate some
objects using others (e.g., picking up a plate with trash on
it and tilting the plate to dump the trash into the trash bin).
In our evaluation, the robot receives prompts that substantively alter the goal of the task, such as “can you clean up
only the trash, but not dishes?”, “can you clean up only the

Figure 4: Task domains used in our evaluation. Across three domains, we evaluate complex instructions, intermediate feedback, and
user interruptions. For example, in Table Bussing, when the user says, “that’s not trash,” the robot correctly puts the bowl back down
instead of putting it away. All images are from policy rollouts.

dishes, but not trash?”, and “bus all the yellowish things”.
This requires the high-level model to reason about the task
and each object (e.g., recognizing that reusable plastic cups
are dishes, while paper cups are trash), then modify the
robot’s “default” behavior of always putting away all items.
This includes understanding what to do and also what not
to do (e.g., avoid touching dishes when asked to collect
only trash). The robot might also receive contextual feed-

back during the task, such as “this is not trash”, “leave the
rest”, or “leave it alone,” which require it to understand the
interjection and respond accordingly.
Sandwich making requires the robot to make a sandwich,
using up to six ingredients as well as bread. This task is
physically difficult, because the robot has to manipulate deformable and delicate ingredients that have to be grasped
carefully and placed precisely. The data contains examples

of different types of sandwiches, with segment labels (e.g.,
“pick up one slice of bread”). We use this task to evaluate complex prompts, such as “hi robot, can you make me
a sandwich with cheese, roast beef, and lettuce?” or “can
you make me a vegetarian sandwich? I’m allergic to pickles”, and live corrections, like “that’s all, no more”.
Grocery shopping entails picking up a combination of requested items from a grocery shelf, placing them into a basket, and placing the basket on a nearby table. This task
requires controlling a bimanual mobile manipulator (see
Figure 4) and interpreting nuanced semantics that involve
variable numbers of objects. Examples of prompts include
“hey robot, can you get me some chips? I’m preparing for
a movie night”, “can you get me something sweet?”, “can
you grab me something to drink?”, “hey robot, can you get
me some Twix and Skittles?”, as well as interjections such
as “I also want some Kitkat”.

most common skill labels in the human-annotated dataset,
and ask GPT-4o to choose among them.
Flat VLA: This comparison directly uses the same π0 lowlevel policy as in Hi Robot, but without any high level or
synthetic data, representing a state-of-the-art approach for
instruction following (Black et al., 2024).
Flat VLA with synthetic data: This ablation uses the
π0 low-level policy by itself, without a high-level model,
but includes the synthetic data in the training data for the
low-level policy, such that it can still process the complex
prompts used in our evaluation. This baseline allows us to
evaluate the benefit of hierarchy independent from the effect of synthetic data.
Hi Robot without synthetic data: This ablation corresponds to our method without synthetic training data, evaluating the importance of including diverse syntheticallygenerated prompts in training. This ablation can be seen as
an advanced VLM-based version of YAY Robot (Shi et al.,
2024), a prior system that uses a high-level model to predict
language commands for a low-level model.

Comparisons and ablations. Our comparisons evaluate
our full method and a number of alternative approaches,
which either employ a different type of high-level strategy,
or do not utilize a hierarchical structure. These include:

5.2. Metrics and Evaluation Protocol

Expert human high level: This oracle baseline uses an
expert human in place of the high-level model, who manually enters language commands for low-level behaviors that
they believe are most likely to succeed at the task. This allows us to understand how much performance is limited by
the low-level policy, with ideal high-level commands.
GPT-4o high-level model: This method uses the same
high-level/low-level decomposition as Hi Robot, but
queries the GPT-4o API-based model for the high level,
while using the same low-level policy. GPT-4o is a significantly larger VLM than the one we use, but it is not
finetuned with our real and synthetic datasets. This comparison is similar to an advanced version of SayCan (Brohan et al., 2023b), which uses an out-of-the-box LLM as
a high-level policy, while this baseline uses a VLM. To
align GPT-4o with the robot’s affordances, we carefully engineer the prompt to include task-relevant instructions that
the low-level policy can follow, determined by ranking the

We report two complementary metrics, measured by a human evaluator who is blind to the method being run. Each
evaluation consists of 20 trials per task per method.
Instruction Accuracy (IA). This score measures how well
the high-level policy’s predicted instruction aligns with human intent, requiring multi-modal understanding of the
current environment and prompt. If the prediction from the
high-level model is consistent with both the user’s command and the current observation, the evaluator marks it
as a correct prediction; otherwise, it is labeled as incorrect.
The Instruction Accuracy for a trial is then computed as the
proportion of correct predictions out of the total number
of predictions. For flat baselines, which lack interpretable
language predictions, scoring is based on the evaluator’s
interpretation of the intent of the policy behavior.
Task Progress (TP). Since all tasks we evaluate are com7

Figure 6: Qualitative Command Comparisons. GPT-4o often (a) misidentifies objects, (b) skips subtasks, or (c) ignores user intent.
Hi Robot consistently produces commands aligned with the robot’s ongoing actions and user requests. Without synthetic data, the highlevel policy aligns well with image observations but ignores user constraints.

and GPT-4o often revert to default behaviors (e.g., picking
up every object in sight, or including almost all ingredients
in a sandwich) when the prompt changes mid-episode.

plex and long-horizon, we record task progress to provide
a granular view of task completion. Task progress quantifies how closely the robot matches the intended goal and is
computed by the proportion of objects that are successfully
placed in their correct locations or configurations.

(4) Expert human guidance reveals the low-level policy’s strengths but underscores the need for high-level
reasoning. With human high-level instructions, the lowlevel policy executes nearly flawlessly, showing that failures stem more from reasoning than actuation. However,
solely relying on human input is not scalable. Hi Robot
bridges this gap via a high-level VLM that aligns with
user prompts and real-time observations, whereas GPT4o’s lack of physical grounding and the flat baseline’s lack
of high-level reasoning hinder performance.

5.3. Core Results
We present results for our system and two key baselines:
a GPT-4o policy and a flat VLA method. Quantitative and
qualitative results are in Figure 5 and Figure 6, and we summarize our findings below.
(1) Hi Robot excels at open-ended instruction following.
Across all tasks, Hi Robot exhibits substantially higher Instruction Accuracy and Task Progress, compared to GPT4o and the flat baseline. It properly identifies, picks up, and
places the correct items – even when prompted to handle
only certain objects or omit ingredients (e.g., “I’m allergic to pickles”). In contrast, GPT-4o frequently loses context once physical interaction begins, issuing nonsensical
commands (e.g., “pick up bermuda triangle”) or sometimes
labeling everything as “plate” or “spoon,” which disrupts
long-horizon planning.

5.4. Ablation Studies
We conduct two key ablations to isolate the contributions
of (1) synthetic data for high-level reasoning, and (2) hierarchical decomposition vs. a single “flat” policy.
(A) Synthetic data is critical for open-ended instruction
following. Comparing Hi Robot (trained on human-labeled
+ synthetic data) to a variant trained solely on humanlabeled data shows that synthetic interactions significantly
boost language flexibility (Figure 7). Without them, the ablated model ignores clarifications (e.g., “this is not trash”)
or includes forbidden items (e.g., pickles), while Hi Robot
smoothly adapts to such feedback, due to the broader coverage of compositional language in synthetic data.

(2) Hi Robot shows strong situated reasoning and adaptation to feedback. When users modify requests mid-task
(e.g., “leave the rest,” “I also want a KitKat”), Hi Robot updates low-level commands accordingly. GPT-4o, however,
often fails to maintain a coherent internal state, leading to
commands like picking up new objects when the gripper is
still occupied or prematurely switching tasks. The flat baseline, on the other hand, does not react to real-time feedback.

(B) Hierarchical structure outperforms a flat policy. We
next compare Hi Robot to a flat policy trained on the same
synthetic data but without a separate reasoning step (Figure 8). The flat model often reverts to clearing all items or
fails to handle partial instructions (“bus only the yellowish
things”), whereas Hi Robot re-checks the prompt at each
high-level step and responds coherently to mid-task up-

(3) Hi Robot is effective across diverse tasks, robots,
and user constraints. On single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile bimanual platforms, Hi Robot is able to handle distinct objects (from fragile cheese slices to tall bottles) while
respecting dynamic constraints (e.g., “bus only yellowish

The two VLMs have nearly identical architectures, with the
only difference being that the low-level policy uses flow
matching to output the actions. Indeed, the separation of
roles at the model level is not fundamental to this design: a
natural step for future work is to combine both systems into
one model, and draw the “System 1” vs “System 2” distinction purely at inference time. Future work could also
interleave high-level and low-level processing more intricately – while our system simply runs high-level inference
at a fixed but lower frequency, an adaptive system might simultaneously process inputs and language asynchronously
at multiple different levels of abstraction, providing for a
more flexible multi-level reasoning procedure.

Our system also has a number of limitations that could be
studied in future work. While we show that our high-level
policy can often break down complex commands into lowlevel steps that the robot can perform physically, the training process for this high level model relies in some amount
of prompt engineering to produce synthetic training examples that induce this behavior. The training process decouples the high-level and low-level models, and they are not
aware of one another’s capabilities except through the training examples. Coupling these two layers more directly,
e.g. by allowing the high-level policy to be more aware of
how successfully the low-level policy completes each command, would be an exciting direction for future work. More
generally, by instantiating both high-level and low-level
reasoning via VLMs, we believe that this design opens the
door for much more intricate integration of these components, such that future work might create robotic visionlanguage-action models that dynamically reason about inputs, feedback, and even their own capabilities to produce
suitable situated response in complex open-world settings.

6. Discussion and Future Work
We presented Hi Robot, a system that uses vision-language
models (VLMs) in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning
over complex prompts, user feedback, and language interaction to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the
task, and then performing that step by directly outputting
low-level action commands. Our system can be thought of
as a VLM-based instantiation of the “System 1” and “System 2” architecture (Kahneman, 2011). The deliberative
“System 2” layer takes the form of a high-level VLM policy, which leverages semantic and visual knowledge from
web-scale pre-training to reason through complex prompts
and user interactions. The physical, reactive “System 1”

Hi Robot: Open-Ended Instruction Following with Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action Models

A. Synthetic Data Generation

between task domains and more robust, open-ended robot
behavior.

A.1. Scenario and Response Categorization
To ensure the quality and diversity of the synthetic data,
we incorporate structured scenario classification and response categorization into the prompt design for pgen , following (Stephan et al., 2024). Specifically, we classify
interactions into different scenario types, such as negative task (where the user instructs the robot what not to
do), situated correction (where the user adjusts an earlier
command based on the evolving task state), and specific
constraint (where the user specifies particular constraints,
such as dietary preferences). In addition, we categorize
the robot’s responses into types such as simple confirmations, clarifications, and error handling. These classifications guide the generation process to ensure a broad range
of user-robot interactions.

B. System and Robot Overview
Our system integrates speech-based interactions and realtime robotic control. Below, we detail the components of
our system, including audio processing, GPU-based inference, and the robot configurations.
B.1. Perception and Language Processing
For speech-based interaction, we use a consumer-grade
lavalier microphone for audio input. Speech-to-text transcription is handled locally using Whisper large-v2 (Radford et al., 2023). For text-to-speech synthesis, we employ
the Cartetia API to generate natural and expressive speech
outputs.

A.2. Prompt Construction for Contextual Grounding

B.2. Inference Hardware

In prompt P, we include a detailed description of the task
(e.g., bussing a table, making a sandwich, grocery shopping) and instruct the model to ground responses in visual
observations and prior context. A key advantage of leveraging large pretrained VLMs is their ability to incorporate
world knowledge when generating interactions. For instance, the model can infer dietary constraints when generating prompts for sandwich-making, producing user commands such as “Can you make a sandwich for me? I’m
lactose intolerant” and an appropriate robot response like
“Sure, I won’t put cheese on it.” Similarly, it can reason
over ambiguous or implicit requests, such as inferring that
“I want something sweet” in a grocery shopping scenario
should lead to suggestions like chocolate or candy.

To support real-time inference, we utilize one to two
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 consumer-grade GPUs.
B.3. Robot System Details
We employ three different robot configurations with various manipulation and mobility capabilities.
UR5e. This setup features a 6-DoF robotic arm equipped
with a parallel jaw gripper. It includes two cameras: a
wrist-mounted camera and an over-the-shoulder camera.
The system operates within a 7-dimensional configuration
and action space.
Bimanual ARX. This configuration consists of two 6DoF ARX arms. The system is equipped with three cameras: two wrist-mounted cameras and one base camera.
The combined system has a 14-dimensional configuration
and action space, enabling dextrous bimanual manipulation
tasks.

To maintain consistency in multi-step tasks, we condition
pgen on prior skill labels within an episode ℓ̂0 , ..., ℓ̂t−1 ,
allowing it to generate coherent user commands that
account for past actions. For instance, if the robot
has already placed lettuce and tomato on a sandwich,
the generated user prompt might request additional ingredients that logically follow. This ensures that the
synthetic interactions reflect realistic task progression
rather than isolated commands. As such, we leverage
pgen (ℓt , ut |I1t , ..., Int , ℓ̂0 , ..., ℓ̂t−1 , ℓ̂t , P) to produce a richer,
more diverse synthetic dataset Dsyn that provides meaningful supervision for training our high-level policy.

Mobile ARX. Built on the Mobile ALOHA (Fu et al.,
2024) platform, this system integrates two 6-DoF ARX
robotic arms mounted on a mobile base. The nonholonomic base introduces two additional action dimensions,
resulting in a 14-dimensional configuration space and a 16dimensional action space. Similar to the bimanual setup,
it includes two wrist-mounted cameras and a base camera,
providing robust visual feedback for navigation and manipulation.

While in this work we generate a separate Dsyn and train
a separate high-level policy for each task (e.g., sandwich
making vs. table cleaning) for clarity and ease of benchmarking, the architecture is readily amenable to a unified
multi-task formulation. In principle, the same hierarchical
approach could be used to train a single high-level policy
across a multitude of tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer

# A2 Architecture Enhancement: ELEGNT & HiRobot Integration Analysis

## Executive Summary (≤ 300 words)

A2 already delivers Apple-grade fluidity by fusing a 1 kHz Teensy impedance loop with ROS 2 motion primitives and cloud LLM reasoning [hybrid-architecture-overview.md §1.1]. ELEGNT adds a rigorously evaluated dual-objective (functional + expressive) trajectory generator and a library of kinesics/proxemics primitives [elegnt.md §3.2], while Hi Robot layers a high-level Vision-Language-Model (VLM) planner over a low-level flow-matching action tokenizer [HiRobot.md §4.1].

The comparison shows A2 lags mainly in (i) expressive motion synthesis breadth and (ii) task-conditioned perception-planning coupling. The proposed 3-month upgrade injects ELEGNT-style expressive primitives and a Hi Robot-style hierarchical VLM while preserving the 1 kHz safety core. Expected gains: +25% Motion-Quality Score, −40ms Reaction-Latency (P1), +2× expression repertoire, and measurable personality coherence via user-study metrics.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 1. Gap Matrix

| Axis | A2 | ELEGNT | Hi Robot | Material KPI Delta |
|------|----|---------|---------|--------------------|
| **Hardware actuation** | Dynamixel MX-64 & LX-224; 1 kHz PID [teensy-firmware-design.md] | Series-elastic BLDC; 2 kHz QP solver | Panda + Mobile Base, 500 Hz | ↑Stiffness bandwidth limits expressive snap |
| **Control-loop rates** | 1 kHz (P0), 100 Hz (P1) | 2 kHz inner, 100 Hz outer | 500 Hz low-lvl & token @15 Hz | None (A2 already ≥ target) |
| **Motion-generation** | Waypoint blends, cubic splines [interfaces-definition.md] | Dual-objective optimal control | Diffusion flow-matching tokens | ↓Expression richness, ↑planning latency |
| **Expression framework** | Hand-authored antenna presets | Kinesics & proxemics primitive set | Gesture tokens auto-learned | ↓Repertoire size; ↓personality coherence |
| **Perception stack** | YOLO + Whisper local §3.1.3 | RGB-D + MoCap phase portrait | Multimodal VLM encoder | ↑Semantics/context coupling |
| **Hierarchical planning** | Cloud LLM → ROS primitive | 3-layer (task/affect/trajectory) | VLM (high) → Flow tokens (low) | ↓Task→motion traceability |
| **Data / learning** | Supervised pose demos + rule heuristics | User-study feedback reward | Massive web-scale vision-lang | ↓Self-improving adaptability |
| **User feedback handling** | None real-time; logs offline | Continuous affect survey | RLHF on interactive rollout | ↓Live persona tuning |

**Highlighted gaps materially degrade Motion-Quality, Reaction-Latency, Expression-Repertoire, Personality-Coherence.**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 5. Risk Register

### Technical
- **QP solver overruns 100 Hz slot** → Mitigation: warm-start & OS-priority pinning.
- **VLM FPS stalls under GPU load** → Mitigation: half-precision & frame skipping.

### Schedule
- **MoCap retargeting delays** → Mitigation: parallelise with synthetic gesture blender.

### UX
- **Over-expressive motions feel uncanny** → Mitigation: A/B test amplitude scaling; fallback to current presets.

### 3.2 Coordinate System

- Origin: Center of base plate
- Z-axis: Vertical up
- X-axis: Forward (toward 0° base point)
- Y-axis: Right-hand rule
- Units: millimeters and radians

### 3.3 Inverse Kinematics

The platform requires solving for 6 actuator lengths given desired pose [x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw]:

```cpp
// Simplified IK calculation
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    Vector3 basePoint = getBasePoint(i);
    Vector3 topPoint = getTopPoint(i);

    // Apply rotation and translation to top point
    Matrix3 R = rotationMatrix(roll, pitch, yaw);
    Vector3 P = Vector3(x, y, z);
    Vector3 transformedTop = R * topPoint + P;

    // Calculate required actuator length
    float length = (transformedTop - basePoint).magnitude();
    actuatorSetpoints[i] = length;
}
```

### 3.4 PID Control Parameters

Start with these values, tune per actuator:
- P: 2.5
- I: 0.1
- D: 0.05
- Output limits: ±100% duty cycle
- Deadband: 0.5mm

---

## 4. Software Implementation

### 4.1 Teensy Firmware Structure

```cpp
// Main control frequencies
IntervalTimer controlTimer;     // 1kHz PID
IntervalTimer safetyTimer;      // 10kHz monitors
IntervalTimer commTimer;        // 100Hz ROS comm

void setup() {
    initializeHardware();
    initializePID();
    controlTimer.begin(controlLoop, 1000);      // 1ms
    safetyTimer.begin(safetyMonitor, 100);     // 0.1ms
    commTimer.begin(rossCommunication, 10000);  // 10ms
}

void controlLoop() {
    readPositions();
    calculateIK();
    updatePID();
    writePWM();
}
```

### 4.2 ROS2 Interface

**Published Topics:**
- `/stewart/state` - Current pose and actuator positions (100Hz)
- `/stewart/status` - Health monitoring data (10Hz)
- `/stewart/imu` - Platform IMU data (200Hz)

**Subscribed Topics:**
- `/stewart/cmd_pose` - Desired platform pose
- `/stewart/cmd_vel` - Velocity commands
- `/stewart/enable` - Enable/disable control

### 4.3 Safety Features

```cpp
void safetyMonitor() {
    // Check all limit switches
    if (anyLimitTriggered()) {
        emergencyStop();
    }

    // Monitor actuator currents (via fault pins)
    if (anyFaultDetected()) {
        disableActuator();
    }

    // Position bounds checking
    if (outOfBounds()) {
        limitMotion();
    }

    // Communication watchdog
    if (millis() - lastCommand > 500) {
        holdPosition();
    }
}
```

## 5. Calibration Procedures

### 5.1 Initial Setup

1. **Home Position Calibration:**
   - Manually center all actuators to 50% extension
   - Measure and record actual lengths
   - Update firmware offset constants

2. **ADC Calibration:**
   ```cpp
   // Per actuator calibration
   const float ADC_TO_MM[6] = {
       24.41,  // (100mm range / 4096 counts)
       24.41,
       24.41,
       24.41,
       24.41,
       24.41
   };
   ```

3. **Kinematic Calibration:**
   - Mount precision level on top plate
   - Command known positions
   - Measure actual vs commanded
   - Update geometry constants

### 5.2 Runtime Calibration

```cpp
void autoCalibrate() {
    // Move to known positions
    moveToExtents();
    recordLimits();

    // Find center position
    moveToCenter();
    zeroIMU();

    // Test each DOF
    for (int dof = 0; dof < 6; dof++) {
        testDOF(dof);
        recordResponse();
    }
}
```

## 6. Safety Systems

### 6.1 Hardware Safety

- **Emergency Stop:** Hardware interrupt, cuts motor power
- **Limit Switches:** Built into L16, wired to interrupts
- **Current Limiting:** DRV8871 VREF set to 2A max
- **Thermal Protection:** DRV8871 internal shutdown

### 6.2 Software Safety

```cpp
class SafetyMonitor {
    float maxVelocity = 50.0;      // mm/s
    float maxAcceleration = 200.0;  // mm/s²
    float maxTilt = 15.0;          // degrees
    float maxExtension = 95.0;      // mm
    float minExtension = 5.0;       // mm

    bool checkMotionLimits(Pose cmd) {
        // Velocity limiting
        // Acceleration limiting
        // Workspace boundary
        // Singularity avoidance
    }
};
```

### 6.3 Fault Recovery

1. **Actuator Fault:** Disable single actuator, maintain stability
2. **Communication Loss:** Hold last safe position
3. **Power Brownout:** Controlled shutdown sequence
4. **Limit Hit:** Back off 5mm, recalibrate

# A2 Robot: Antenna Expression System

## Overview

The antenna expression system adds emotional range and personality to the A2 robot through synchronized Wi-Fi antenna "ears." The system combines MG996R servos for large expressive sweeps with LX224 servos for fine twitch-like movements, creating a rich vocabulary of non-verbal communication.

## Hardware Configuration

### Servo Selection Strategy

**MG996R Digital Servos (2×):**
- **Purpose:** Large, playful sweeps for primary expressions
- **Control:** PWM via PCA9685 @ 50Hz
- **Range:** 180° rotation capability
- **Characteristics:** High torque, moderate speed, coarse positioning
- **Applications:** "Surprise", "joy", "alertness", "curiosity"

**LX224 Serial Bus Servos (2×):**
- **Purpose:** Fast twitch-like flicks for subtle expressions
- **Control:** RS485 @ 250kbps via dedicated UART
- **Range:** 270° rotation capability
- **Characteristics:** Precise positioning, fast response, fine control
- **Applications:** "Nervousness", "attention shifts", "micro-expressions"

### Physical Mounting

```cpp
// Antenna mounting configuration
struct AntennaMount {
    float base_height_mm;       // Height above head center
    float lateral_offset_mm;    // Distance from head centerline
    float forward_offset_mm;    // Distance from head rotation axis
    float antenna_length_mm;    // Carbon fiber tube length
};

AntennaMount antenna_config = {
    .base_height_mm = 80,       // Clear head rotation envelope
    .lateral_offset_mm = 45,    // Wide stance for visibility
    .forward_offset_mm = 15,    // Slight forward bias
    .antenna_length_mm = 120    // Lightweight carbon fiber tubes
};
```

### Vibration Isolation

**Neoprene Mounts:**
- Decouple antenna servo vibration from head structure
- Prevent resonance with head motion at 1kHz frequencies
- Maintain antenna pointing accuracy during head movements

**IMU Filtering:**
```cpp
// Anti-vibration filter for IMU during antenna motion
void filterAntennaVibration() {
    // 40Hz low-pass filter to remove antenna servo noise
    static float alpha = 0.08; // 40Hz cutoff @ 1kHz sample rate

    filtered_imu.accel_x = alpha * raw_imu.accel_x + (1-alpha) * filtered_imu.accel_x;
    filtered_imu.accel_y = alpha * raw_imu.accel_y + (1-alpha) * filtered_imu.accel_y;
    filtered_imu.accel_z = alpha * raw_imu.accel_z + (1-alpha) * filtered_imu.accel_z;
}
```

## Expression Library

    // LX224 fine movement parameters
    int16_t lx224_left_angle;    // -135 to +135 degrees
    int16_t lx224_right_angle;   // -135 to +135 degrees
    uint16_t lx224_duration_ms;  // Movement duration

    // Synchronization with head motion
    bool sync_with_head;         // Follow head movements
    float sync_gain;             // Coupling strength (0.0-1.0)

## Control Implementation

### FreeRTOS Task Structure

```cpp
// 50Hz antenna control task
void antennaControlTaskFunc(void* parameters) {
    TickType_t xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();

    while(1) {
        // Check for new expression commands

        }

## Head Motion Synchronization

### Coupling Algorithm

```cpp
void synchronizeWithHeadMotion() {
    if(!current_expression_state.sync_with_head) return;

    // Get current head orientation from servo feedback
    float head_yaw = servos[SERVO_YAW].present_position_deg;
    float head_pitch = servos[SERVO_PITCH].present_position_deg;

    // Calculate antenna offset based on head motion
    float sync_gain = current_expression_state.sync_gain;

    // Yaw coupling: antennas tilt in opposite direction of head rotation
    float yaw_offset = -head_yaw * sync_gain * 0.3; // 30% coupling to yaw

    // Pitch coupling: antennas angle forward/back with head pitch
    float pitch_offset = head_pitch * sync_gain * 0.5; // 50% coupling to pitch

    // Apply offsets to base expression angles
    expression_state.mg996_target_left += (int16_t)yaw_offset;
    expression_state.mg996_target_right += (int16_t)yaw_offset;

    expression_state.lx224_target_left += (int16_t)pitch_offset;
    expression_state.lx224_target_right += (int16_t)pitch_offset;

    // Clamp to servo limits
    expression_state.mg996_target_left = constrain(expression_state.mg996_target_left, -90, 90);
    expression_state.mg996_target_right = constrain(expression_state.mg996_target_right, -90, 90);
    expression_state.lx224_target_left = constrain(expression_state.lx224_target_left, -135, 135);
    expression_state.lx224_target_right = constrain(expression_state.lx224_target_right, -135, 135);
}
```

## ROS 2 Integration

### Expression Command Interface

```python
# ROS 2 message definition for antenna expressions
from a2_msgs.msg import AntennaExpression

class AntennaExpressionNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('antenna_expression_node')

        # Subscribe to emotion/expression commands
        self.expression_sub = self.create_subscription(
            AntennaExpression,
            '/a2/antenna/expression',
            self.expression_callback,
            10
        )

        # Subscribe to head motion for predictive coupling
        self.head_motion_sub = self.create_subscription(
            JointState,
            '/a2/head/joint_states',
            self.head_motion_callback,
            10
        )

        # UDP interface to Teensy
        self.teensy_interface = TeensyUDPInterface()

    def expression_callback(self, msg):
        # Convert ROS message to Teensy command
        antenna_cmd = {
            'expression_id': msg.expression_id,
            'duration_ms': msg.duration_ms,
            'sync_gain': msg.sync_gain,
            'repeat_count': msg.repeat_count
        }

        # Send to Teensy via UDP
        self.teensy_interface.send_antenna_command(antenna_cmd)

    def head_motion_callback(self, msg):
        # Forward head motion state for synchronization
        head_state = {
            'yaw_deg': msg.position[0],
            'pitch_deg': msg.position[1],
            'roll_deg': msg.position[2],
            'timestamp': self.get_clock().now().nanoseconds
        }

        self.teensy_interface.send_head_state(head_state)
```

### Emotion Mapping

```python
# Map high-level emotions to antenna expressions
EMOTION_TO_EXPRESSION = {
    'happy': EXPR_CURIOUS,
    'excited': EXPR_SURPRISE,
    'alert': EXPR_ALERT,
    'thinking': EXPR_THINKING,
    'nervous': EXPR_NERVOUS,
    'neutral': EXPR_NEUTRAL,
    'surprised': EXPR_SURPRISE,
    'confused': EXPR_TWITCH_LEFT
}

def trigger_emotion_expression(emotion_name, intensity=1.0):
    """Trigger antenna expression based on detected emotion"""
    if emotion_name in EMOTION_TO_EXPRESSION:
        expression_id = EMOTION_TO_EXPRESSION[emotion_name]

        # Scale sync gain based on emotion intensity
        sync_gain = 0.3 + (intensity * 0.5)  # 0.3 to 0.8 range

        # Send expression command
        expression_msg = AntennaExpression()
        expression_msg.expression_id = expression_id
        expression_msg.sync_gain = sync_gain
        expression_msg.duration_ms = int(500 + intensity * 1000)  # 0.5-1.5s

        return expression_msg
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing Requirements

**MG996R Response:**
- Movement initiation: <50ms
- Full sweep (90°): 200-800ms depending on expression
- Position accuracy: ±2° (adequate for expressive motion)

**LX224 Response:**
- Movement initiation: <20ms
- Fine movement (30°): 80-200ms
- Position accuracy: ±0.5° (precise for subtle expressions)

### Power Consumption

```cpp
// Power budget estimation
struct AntennaPowerProfile {
    float mg996_idle_ma;        // Holding current
    float mg996_active_ma;      // Moving current
    float lx224_idle_ma;        // Holding current
    float lx224_active_ma;      // Moving current
    float control_overhead_ma;  // Teensy processing overhead
};

AntennaPowerProfile power_profile = {
    .mg996_idle_ma = 50,        // 2× servos @ 25mA each
    .mg996_active_ma = 800,     // 2× servos @ 400mA each (peak)
    .lx224_idle_ma = 40,        // 2× servos @ 20mA each
    .lx224_active_ma = 200,     // 2× servos @ 100mA each (peak)
    .control_overhead_ma = 10   // Teensy UART/PWM processing
};

// Total power: 100mA idle, 1010mA peak (both types moving)
// Average during normal operation: ~300mA
```

This antenna expression system adds significant personality and emotional range to the A2 robot while maintaining the refined architecture's focus on smooth, natural motion. The dual-servo approach provides both large expressive gestures and subtle micro-expressions, creating a rich vocabulary for non-verbal communication.

## Architecture Decision: I2C/Universal Serial Bus (USB) Over CSI

### Why Multi-Sensor I2C/Universal Serial Bus (USB) Approach

- **Problem Solved**: CSI ribbon cables across gimbal joints proved unreliable due to flexing and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
- **Solution**: Distributed sensor approach using I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A) and Universal Serial Bus (USB) connections
- **Benefits**:
  - More robust connections through gimbal movement
  - Easier cable management and replacement
  - Better Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) isolation
  - Modular sensor placement

### Connection Strategy

- **RealSense D455**: Universal Serial Bus (USB) 3.0 connection to Raspberry Pi 5
- **Arducam Time-of-Flight (ToF)**: I2C connection via TCA9548A multiplexer
- **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors**: I2C via TCA9548A multiplexer
- **VL53L0X sensors**: I2C via TCA9548A multiplexer
- **Power monitoring**: I2C via TCA9548A multiplexer

## Depth Camera Configuration

### Physical Mounting

- **RealSense D455**: Centered at "eye level" of head assembly, Universal Serial Bus (USB) 3.0 cable routed through gimbal with service loop
- **Arducam Time-of-Flight (ToF)**: Mounted 50-75mm directly above Intel RealSense D455, I2C connection via TCA9548A
- **VL53L0X sensors**: Distributed around head perimeter for 360° proximity detection
- **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors**: Head Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in head assembly, base Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in stationary base
- **Cable Management**: All I2C connections use flexible silicone wire, Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable has strain relief
- **Vibration isolation**: TPU dampeners for all camera mounts

### Software Configuration

```yaml

# Multi-sensor configuration for robust perception

```python

### Calibration Procedure

1. Capture checkerboard images from both cameras
2. Run stereo calibration between cameras
3. Generate transformation matrix for point cloud fusion
4. Validate with known objects at various distances

## Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Configuration

### I2C Multiplexer Setup (TCA9548A)

The TCA9548A TCA9548A I2C multiplexer enables multiple sensors with the same address to coexist on the same I2C bus, critical for our multi-sensor architecture.

```cpp
// TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer Configuration

# define MUX_ADDR 0x70

# define HEAD_IMU_CHANNEL 0

# define BASE_IMU_CHANNEL 1

# define ARDUCAM_TOF_CHANNEL 2

# define VL53L0X_FRONT_CHANNEL 3

# define VL53L0X_BACK_CHANNEL 4

# define VL53L0X_LEFT_CHANNEL 5

# define VL53L0X_RIGHT_CHANNEL 6

# define POWER_MON_CHANNEL 7

void setupMultiplexedSensors() {
    // Initialize IMUs
    selectMuxChannel(HEAD_IMU_CHANNEL);
    headIMU.begin(0x69);  // Head Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

    selectMuxChannel(BASE_IMU_CHANNEL);
    baseIMU.begin(0x68);  // Base Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

    // Initialize Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera
    selectMuxChannel(ARDUCAM_TOF_CHANNEL);
    arducamToF.begin();

    // Initialize VL53L0X sensors
    selectMuxChannel(VL53L0X_FRONT_CHANNEL);
    frontRangeSensor.begin(0x30);

    selectMuxChannel(VL53L0X_BACK_CHANNEL);
    backRangeSensor.begin(0x31);

    // ... continue for all sensors
}

void selectMuxChannel(uint8_t channel) {
    Wire.beginTransmission(MUX_ADDR);
    Wire.write(1 << channel);
    Wire.endTransmission();
}
```

### Calibration Values Storage

Store magnetometer calibration in EEPROM:
- Hard iron offsets
- Soft iron matrix
- Gyroscope bias
- Accelerometer scale factors

## Power Monitoring Setup

### INA219 Configuration

```python

# Power monitoring assignments

monitors = {
    "main_12v": INA219(0x40),
    "servo_bus": INA219(0x41),
    "pi_5v": INA219(0x42),
    "sensors_5v": INA219(0x43),
    "l16_power": INA219(0x44),
    "system_total": INA219(0x45)
}

# Set calibration for expected current ranges

monitors["main_12v"].set_calibration_32V_8A()
monitors["servo_bus"].set_calibration_16V_5A()
```

## Testing Checklist

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Teensy 4.1 microcontroller is a core component of the A2 Robot's onboard system, responsible for ultra-low latency tasks, direct hardware interaction, real-time sensor processing, and acting as the primary safety guardian. This document outlines the architecture, functionalities, and communication protocol of the Teensy 4.1 firmware.

The primary purposes of the Teensy 4.1 firmware are:
-   Execute **1kHz closed-loop servo control** with DMA-based Dynamixel communication
-   Implement **500Hz impedance overlay** with virtual spring-damper model and friction compensation
-   Provide **Ultra-Fast Safety Layer (P0)** with immediate hardware intervention
-   Control **antenna servo expressions** (MG996R + LX224) synchronized with head movements
-   Manage **1kHz sensor fusion** from dual ICM-20948 IMUs and VL53L0X proximity ring
-   Receive **100Hz motion primitives** from ROS 2 via UDP ring buffer
-   Send **telemetry packets** to Pi 5 at 1kHz for monitoring and logging

## 2. Hardware Context

-   **Microcontroller:** Teensy 4.1 (ARM Cortex-M7 @ 600MHz)
-   **Primary Servos:**
    -   2× XL430-W250-T (neck yaw/pitch): Current-based position mode @ 1kHz
    -   1× XL330-M288-T (neck roll): Velocity-based position mode @ 1kHz
    -   **Communication:** DMA-based Dynamixel bus at 1 Mbps TTL
-   **Antenna Servos:**
    -   2× MG996R: PWM via PCA9685 @50Hz for large expressive sweeps
    -   2× LX224: RS485 @250kbps for fast twitch-like expressions
-   **Sensors:**
    -   2× ICM-20948 IMUs: Head (TCA channel 0, 0x69) and Base (channel 1, 0x68)
    -   4× VL53L0X proximity: Ring layout on TCA channels 3-6 for blind-spot detection
    -   Emergency Stop button and safety monitoring inputs
-   **Communication:**
    -   **Pi 5:** UDP interface for waypoint commands and telemetry
    -   **Debug:** Dedicated UART for development logging

## 3. Firmware Architecture

-   **Operating System:** **FreeRTOS**. The firmware utilizes FreeRTOS for preemptive multitasking, task scheduling, inter-task communication (queues), and resource protection (mutexes), ensuring deterministic behavior for safety-critical operations.
-   **Modularity:** Code is organized into modules for specific functionalities (e.g., `safety_monitor.c`, `actuator_feedback.c`, `imu_handler.c`, `serial_comms.c`).
-   **Interrupt-Driven I/O:** Used for time-critical inputs like the E-Stop button.

### 3.1. RTOS Tasks and Priorities

The firmware implements the following FreeRTOS tasks optimized for 1kHz control:

1.  **`servoControlTask` (Priority: 30 - Highest Real-Time):**
    -   **Period:** 1ms (1000Hz)
    -   **Responsibilities:** DMA-based bulk read from XL430/XL330 servos, executes position control loop, applies torque commands. Handles syncBulkRead+syncWrite in <0.5ms window.
2.  **`impedanceOverlayTask` (Priority: 28):**
    -   **Period:** 2ms (500Hz)
    -   **Responsibilities:** Computes virtual spring-damper torques, friction compensation, applies impedance model to servo goals. Updates impedance parameters from motion primitives.
3.  **`safetyMonitorTask` (Priority: 26):**
    -   **Period:** 1ms (1000Hz), event-driven for E-Stop
    -   **Responsibilities:** Monitors E-Stop, servo limits, IMU fall detection, current limits. Immediate P0 safety responses including servo torque cutoff.
4.  **`sensorFusionTask` (Priority: 24):**
    -   **Period:** 1ms (1000Hz)
    -   **Responsibilities:** Reads dual IMUs + VL53L0X ring, performs sensor fusion, updates telemetry structure with fused state estimates.
5.  **`antennaControlTask` (Priority: 20):**
    -   **Period:** 20ms (50Hz)
    -   **Responsibilities:** Controls MG996R (PWM) and LX224 (RS485) antenna servos, synchronizes expressions with head movements.
6.  **`udpCommunicationTask` (Priority: 16):**
    -   **Operation:** Handles UDP communication with Pi 5
    -   **Reception:** Processes 100Hz waypoint commands from ring buffer, validates and queues motion primitives
    -   **Transmission:** Sends 1kHz telemetry packets with servo states, IMU data, and safety status
7.  **`heartbeatTask` (Priority: 4 - Lowest):**
    -   **Period:** 100ms (10Hz)
    -   **Responsibilities:** LED status indication, firmware version reporting, system health monitoring

### 3.2. Inter-Task Communication & Resource Protection

-   **Telemetry Data:** A shared data structure (e.g., a C struct) holds the latest sensor readings (L16 positions, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data) and system status. Access to this structure by `actuatorFeedbackTask`, `imuProcessingTask`, and `serialCommunicationTask` (for populating outgoing telemetry packets) is protected by a FreeRTOS mutex (e.g., `telemetryDataMutex`) to prevent race conditions.
-   **Outgoing Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) Packets:** Tasks like `safetyMonitorTask` (for emergency packets) and `heartbeatTask` (for status packets), and `serialCommunicationTask` itself (for regular telemetry) will send data by placing formatted packet structures onto a FreeRTOS queue (e.g., `uartTxQueue`). The `serialCommunicationTask` dequeues these and handles the actual Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) transmission. This decouples packet generation from transmission.

## 4. UDP Communication Protocol (Pi 5 Interface)

High-speed UDP communication replaces UART for reduced latency.

### 4.1. Packet Structure

**Waypoint Command (Pi 5 → Teensy):**
```cpp
struct WaypointCommand {
    uint32_t timestamp_ms;
    float neck_yaw_deg;         // XL430 goal position
    float neck_pitch_deg;       // XL430 goal position
    float neck_roll_deg;        // XL330 goal position
    float impedance_stiffness;  // Virtual spring constant
    float impedance_damping;    // Virtual damper constant
    uint8_t antenna_expression; // Expression ID for MG996R/LX224
    uint16_t checksum;
};
```

**Telemetry Packet (Teensy → Pi 5):**
```cpp
struct TelemetryPacket {
    uint32_t timestamp_ms;
    float servo_positions[3];    // Current XL430/XL330 positions
    float servo_currents[3];     // Current torque feedback
    float imu_head_quat[4];      // Head IMU quaternion
    float imu_base_quat[4];      // Base IMU quaternion
    uint8_t vl53_distances[4];   // Proximity sensor readings
    uint8_t safety_status;       // P0 status bits
    uint16_t checksum;
};
```

### 4.2. Communication Timing

**Ring Buffer Management:**
- Teensy maintains 16-frame ring buffer for incoming waypoints
- Pi 5 sends waypoints at 100Hz with 16ms lookahead
- Servo control interpolates between buffered waypoints at 1kHz
- Buffer underrun triggers safe fallback to last known position

**Packet Rates:**
- **Waypoint Commands:** 100Hz (Pi 5 → Teensy)
- **Telemetry Packets:** 1kHz (Teensy → Pi 5)
- **Emergency Events:** Immediate (Teensy → Pi 5)

**Safety Monitoring:**
- Watchdog timeout: 50ms without Pi 5 waypoints triggers safe stop
- Emergency events bypass normal packet queue
- P0 safety responses execute within 1ms of detection

### 4.3. Error Handling & Reliability

-   CRC16 validation for all UDP packets. Invalid packets are discarded.
-   Sequence number tracking prevents replay attacks and detects dropped packets.
-   Watchdog timer monitors waypoint reception. Missing packets >50ms triggers safe stop.
-   Emergency events use separate high-priority UDP socket for guaranteed delivery.
-   Ring buffer provides graceful degradation during temporary communication loss.

### 4.4. Sensor Bus Management

The Teensy 4.1 manages sensors through TCA9548A I2C multiplexer:

```cpp
// TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer Layout
#define TCAADDR 0x70
#define IMU_HEAD_CHANNEL    0   // ICM-20948 @ 0x69
#define IMU_BASE_CHANNEL    1   // ICM-20948 @ 0x68
#define VL53_LEFT_CHANNEL   3   // VL53L0X @ 0x29
#define VL53_RIGHT_CHANNEL  4   // VL53L0X @ 0x29
#define VL53_UP_CHANNEL     5   // VL53L0X @ 0x29
#define VL53_DOWN_CHANNEL   6   // VL53L0X @ 0x29

void tcaselect(uint8_t channel) {
  Wire.beginTransmission(TCAADDR);
  Wire.write(1 << channel);
  Wire.endTransmission();
}

// 1kHz Sensor Fusion Task
void sensorFusionTaskFunc(void* parameters) {
  TickType_t xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();
  while(1) {
    // Read Head IMU (1ms)
    tcaselect(IMU_HEAD_CHANNEL);
    headIMU.readSensor();

    // Read Base IMU (1ms)
    tcaselect(IMU_BASE_CHANNEL);
    baseIMU.readSensor();

    // VL53L0X ring every 20th cycle (20ms, 50Hz)
    static uint8_t vl53_counter = 0;
    if (++vl53_counter >= 20) {
      readVL53Ring();
      vl53_counter = 0;
    }

    // Sensor fusion and telemetry update
    updateFusedState(&headIMU, &baseIMU);

    vTaskDelayUntil(&xLastWakeTime, pdMS_TO_TICKS(1)); // 1kHz
  }
}
```

### 4.5. Dynamixel Communication Implementation

DMA-based high-speed servo communication:

```cpp
// Dynamixel Protocol 2.0 - 1kHz Control Loop
#define DXL_UART_PORT     Serial1
#define DXL_DIR_PIN       2
#define SERVO_COUNT       3

struct ServoState {
  uint8_t id;
  uint16_t present_position;
  uint16_t present_current;
  uint16_t goal_position;
  uint16_t goal_current;
};

ServoState servos[SERVO_COUNT] = {
  {.id = 1}, // XL430 Yaw
  {.id = 2}, // XL430 Pitch
  {.id = 3}  // XL330 Roll
};

// 1kHz Servo Control with DMA
void servoControlTaskFunc(void* parameters) {
  TickType_t xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();

  while(1) {
    // Bulk read all servo positions (0.3ms)
    dxl_bulk_read_start();
    for(int i = 0; i < SERVO_COUNT; i++) {
      dxl_bulk_read_add(servos[i].id, DXL_PRESENT_POSITION, 4);
    }
    dxl_bulk_read_txrx();

    // Process impedance overlay (0.1ms)
    applyImpedanceModel();

    // Bulk write servo commands (0.2ms)
    dxl_bulk_write_start();
    for(int i = 0; i < SERVO_COUNT; i++) {
      if(i < 2) { // XL430 current-based position
        dxl_bulk_write_add(servos[i].id, DXL_GOAL_CURRENT, servos[i].goal_current);
      } else { // XL330 velocity-based position
        dxl_bulk_write_add(servos[i].id, DXL_GOAL_POSITION, servos[i].goal_position);
      }
    }
    dxl_bulk_write_txrx();

    vTaskDelayUntil(&xLastWakeTime, pdMS_TO_TICKS(1)); // 1kHz
  }
}
```

## 5. Safety Layer (P0) Implementation Details

**Critical Safety Monitoring (1kHz):**
-   **E-Stop:** Hardware interrupt with 1ms response time
-   **Servo Current Limits:** XL430 current feedback monitoring for overcurrent/undercurrent
-   **IMU Fall Detection:** Real-time tilt angle monitoring with configurable thresholds
-   **Position Limits:** Software limits for neck servo ranges with immediate cutoff
-   **Communication Watchdog:** 50ms timeout triggers safe stop if Pi 5 waypoints cease

**P0 Safety Responses:**
```cpp
void executeP0Safety(P0_EVENT_TYPE event) {
  // Immediate servo torque cutoff (<1ms)
  for(int i = 0; i < SERVO_COUNT; i++) {
    dxl_write_word(servos[i].id, DXL_TORQUE_ENABLE, 0);
  }

  // Antenna servos to safe position
  antennasSafePosition();

  // Emergency UDP packet
  sendEmergencyPacket(event);

  // Enter safe state until manual reset
  system_state = STATE_P0_EMERGENCY;
}

## 6. Impedance Control Implementation

**Virtual Spring-Damper Model:**
```cpp
// Impedance parameters per servo
struct ImpedanceParams {
  float stiffness;    // Spring constant (Nm/rad)
  float damping;      // Damper constant (Nm*s/rad)
  float friction;     // Static friction compensation (Nm)
};

// 500Hz Impedance Overlay
void applyImpedanceModel() {
  for(int i = 0; i < SERVO_COUNT; i++) {
    float pos_error = servos[i].goal_position - servos[i].present_position;
    float vel_estimate = (pos_error - prev_pos_error[i]) * 500.0; // Hz

    // Virtual spring-damper torque
    float spring_torque = impedance_params[i].stiffness * pos_error;
    float damper_torque = impedance_params[i].damping * vel_estimate;
    float friction_comp = (pos_error > 0) ? impedance_params[i].friction :
                                           -impedance_params[i].friction;

    float total_torque = spring_torque + damper_torque + friction_comp;

    // Convert to servo current command (XL430 only)
    if(i < 2) {
      servos[i].goal_current = torqueToCurrentLookup(total_torque);
    }

    prev_pos_error[i] = pos_error;
  }
}
```

**Servo Configuration:**
- **XL430 (Yaw/Pitch):** Current-based position mode with impedance overlay
- **XL330 (Roll):** Velocity-based position mode for ±20° range
- **Static Friction:** Measured at 6-8 mNm, compensated via Punch parameter

## 7. Antenna Expression System

**Hardware Configuration:**
```cpp
// MG996R servos via PCA9685 PWM driver
#define PCA9685_ADDR      0x40
#define ANTENNA_LEFT_PIN  0
#define ANTENNA_RIGHT_PIN 1

// LX224 servos via RS485
#define LX224_UART        Serial2
#define LX224_LEFT_ID     1
#define LX224_RIGHT_ID    2

// Expression mappings synchronized with head motion
struct AntennaExpression {
  uint8_t expression_id;
  int16_t mg996_left_angle;   // Large sweep angles
  int16_t mg996_right_angle;
  int16_t lx224_left_angle;   // Fine twitch movements
  int16_t lx224_right_angle;
  uint16_t duration_ms;
};

// Expression library
AntennaExpression expressions[] = {
  {EXPR_ALERT,    {45, -45, 10, -10, 200}},
  {EXPR_CURIOUS,  {20, 20, 15, 15, 300}},
  {EXPR_SURPRISE, {60, 60, 0, 0, 150}},
  {EXPR_NEUTRAL,  {0, 0, 0, 0, 500}}
};
```

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Execution Router is an onboard software component running on the A2 Robot's Raspberry Pi 5. It is responsible for receiving, prioritizing, blending (in later phases), and dispatching motion and behavior commands from multiple sources—primarily cloud-derived directives (via the Local Shared State Cache - Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)) and local safety/reflex systems—to the robot's hardware controllers.

The key purposes of the Execution Router are:
-   To act as the **final arbiter** for all physical movements and expressive actions of the A2 head/neck assembly.
-   To ensure that commands are executed according to a strict **priority system**, where safety and stability take absolute precedence.
-   To translate abstract commands into concrete, hardware-specific target values (e.g., servo angles, L16 actuator lengths).
-   To manage access to shared physical resources (actuators, servos).
-   To perform final **safety and constraint validation** (e.g., joint limits) before issuing commands to hardware.
-   To provide feedback on command execution status to the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).

### 1.1. Phase 1 Implementation Scope

For Phase 1 (Essential Core), as detailed in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`, the Execution Router will implement core functionalities with some simplifications:

-   **Priority Queues:** The P0-P3 priority queue structure will be implemented.
-   **Preemption:** P0 (Hardware Emergency from Teensy 4.1) and P1 (Software Reflex from Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS)) commands will have full preemption over P2 (Cloud Task) and P3 (Cloud Expression) commands.
-   **Command Execution:** Basic execution of P2/P3 commands received from the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) (originating from simplified cloud LLMs).
-   **Blending:** Complex command blending (e.g., sophisticated additive blending of P2 tasks with P3 expressions on the same joints) is deferred. Phase 1 will focus on:
    -   Clear preemption by higher priorities.
    -   Sequential execution if commands conflict.
    -   Simple spatial concurrency (allowing non-conflicting movements on different joint groups, e.g., head yaw while neck base lifts, if kinematically independent enough).
-   **Kinematic Translation:** Core inverse kinematics for the 3-actuator parallel neck base (to translate Z-lift, base pitch, base roll into individual L16 target lengths) and direct mapping for head servos (yaw, pitch, roll) will be implemented.
-   **Constraint Checking:** Enforcement of hard joint limits. Velocity/acceleration ramping will be basic.
-   **Feedback:** Basic status reporting to Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).

## 2. Architectural Placement and Responsibilities

-   **Location:** Runs as a ROS 2 Humble node on the Raspberry Pi 5, within the `a2_execution` package.
-   **Inputs (Subscriptions):**
    -   `/shared_state/local_cache/active_directives` (`a2_interfaces/ActiveDirectivesForExecution`): Primary source of tasks (motion, gesture, expression commands) from the cloud, via Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
    -   `/reflex/commands` (`a2_interfaces/CloudMotionCommand` or similar type): From the local Fast Path Reflex System (Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS)), treated as P1 priority.
    -   `/teensy/p0_emergency_event` (`a2_interfaces/P0EmergencyEvent`): For P0 hardware emergency stops/actions signaled by Teensy 4.1.
-   **Outputs (Publishers):**
    -   Low-level commands to Hardware Interface Layer (Hardware Interface Layer (HIL)) nodes:
        -   To `l16_control_node` (for Z-lift, base pitch, base roll): e.g., `/l16/command/z_lift_mm`, `/l16/command/base_pitch_rad`, `/l16/command/base_roll_rad`.
        -   To `dynamixel_interface_node`: e.g., `/dynamixel/command_position/[joint_name]`.
    -   `/execution_router/status` (`a2_interfaces/ExecutionRouterStatus`): Its current operational state, what command (if any) is being processed, for Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) and diagnostics.
-   **Core Responsibilities (Phase 1 Focus):**
    1.  **Command Ingestion & Prioritization:** Receive and queue commands based on source and priority.
    2.  **P0/P1 Preemption:** Ensure immediate execution of P0/P1 commands, canceling/pausing lower-priority tasks.
    3.  **P2/P3 Task Processing:** Sequentially process P2 tasks from the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC). Basic P3 expressions might be overlaid if they don't conflict directly with P2 joint usage.
    4.  **Kinematic Translation:** Convert desired abstract poses/motions (e.g., head orientation, neck Z-lift) into target values for individual actuators.
    5.  **Constraint Enforcement:** Check against joint limits.
    6.  **Hardware Command Dispatch:** Send computed target values to Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) nodes.
    7.  **Status Reporting:** Publish basic operational status.

## 3. Priority Queue System (Local Execution Priorities)

1.  **P0 (Hardware Emergency):** Absolute highest priority.
    -   **Source:** `/teensy/p0_emergency_event`.
    -   **Action:** Immediate stop of all motion by ceasing commands to Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) and/or sending explicit "disable torque" / "stop Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)" commands. Log event.
2.  **P1 (Software Reflex / Stability):** High priority.
    -   **Source:** `/reflex/commands` from Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS).
    -   **Action:** Preempts P2/P3. Commands are processed and dispatched.
3.  **P2 (Cloud Task Execution):** Normal priority for primary robot behaviors.
    -   **Source:** `motion_commands` and primary `gesture_commands` from `/shared_state/local_cache/active_directives` (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)).
    -   **Action:** Executed when no P0/P1 commands are active or conflicting.
4.  **P3 (Cloud Expressive Nuance / Idle):** Lowest priority.
    -   **Source:** `expression_commands` and secondary/subtle `gesture_commands` from `/shared_state/local_cache/active_directives` (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)).
    -   **Action:** Executed if resources are available and commands do not conflict with P0-P2. (Phase 1: May be simple overlay if non-conflicting, or ignored if P2 is active on same joints).

### Queue Management (Phase 1)

-   Simple FIFO queues per priority level.
-   The router checks P0, then P1, then P2, then P3 in each processing cycle.
-   Commands should have a timestamp; the router might ignore commands older than a certain threshold (e.g., >500ms for P2/P3) to avoid executing stale directives, especially after a disconnect/reconnect to cloud. TTLs from cloud directives will be honored.

## 4. Command Processing Pipeline (Phase 1 Loop @ e.g., 50-100 Hz)

1.  **Ingest Commands:** Check all subscribed topics for new commands and enqueue them into respective priority queues.
2.  **Process P0 Queue:** If a P0 command exists:
    -   Execute P0 action (e.g., send stop/disable commands to all Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) actuator interfaces).
    -   Clear P1, P2, P3 queues.
    -   Set status to "P0_EMERGENCY_ACTIVE". Publish status.
    -   Return (skip further processing in this cycle).
3.  **Process P1 Queue:** If a P1 command exists (and no P0 active):
    -   Dequeue the command.
    -   Perform kinematic translation & constraint checks.
    -   Dispatch to Hardware Interface Layer (HIL).
    -   Set status to "P1_REFLEX_ACTIVE". Publish status.
    -   (Phase 1: A P1 command will likely monopolize relevant actuators, preventing P2/P3 on those actuators).
    -   Return or proceed to P2 if P1 command is very short-lived or affects different resources.
4.  **Process P2 Queue:** If a P2 command exists (and no P0/P1 active or conflicting):
    -   Dequeue the command (e.g., one `CloudMotionCommand` primitive).
    -   Perform kinematic translation & constraint checks.
    -   Dispatch to Hardware Interface Layer (HIL).
    -   Set status to "P2_TASK_ACTIVE". Publish status.
    -   (Phase 1: Process one P2 primitive at a time to completion before starting next, unless they are explicitly sequenced in the cloud directive).
    -   Return or proceed to P3.
5.  **Process P3 Queue:** If a P3 command exists (and no P0/P1 active, and P2 allows/is not conflicting):
    -   Dequeue the command.
    -   Perform kinematic translation & constraint checks.
    -   Dispatch to Hardware Interface Layer (HIL).
    -   Set status to "P3_EXPRESSION_ACTIVE" (or "P2_P3_BLENDED_BASIC" if applicable). Publish status.
6.  **Idle State:** If no commands are active in any queue, set status to "IDLE". Publish status.
    -   **Phase 1 Fallback:** If Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)'s `cloud_sync_status.connectivity_to_cloud` is "disconnected", the Execution Router might be commanded by a local supervisor to enter a predefined "local_idle_pattern" (a simple P2 sequence).

## 5. Command Blending (Phase 1 Simplification)

-   **Preemption is Key:** Higher priority commands will stop or pause lower priority commands if they use the same actuators.
-   **No Geometric/Additive Blending:** Sophisticated blending of P2 and P3 commands affecting the same joints simultaneously (e.g., smoothly adding a head tilt to an ongoing tracking motion by adjusting target values) is deferred to Phase 2.
-   **Spatial Concurrency:** If a P2 command uses only head servos (yaw/pitch/roll) and a P3 command uses only neck base L16s (Z-lift), they *might* be allowed to execute concurrently if the kinematics are treated as reasonably independent for Phase 1. This needs careful consideration of the URDF and robot model.
-   **Sequential Execution:** If a P2 motion is active, a new P3 gesture for the same joints will likely wait or be discarded.

## 6. Kinematic Translation and Movement Primitives

-   **Input:** Abstract commands from `active_directives_for_execution` (e.g., `CloudMotionCommand` with type "smooth_orient_head", target orientation, duration).
-   **Neck Base (3xL16 Parallel Mechanism):**
    -   The `l16_control_node` (part of Hardware Interface Layer (HIL), but logic could be integrated into ER) will contain the inverse kinematics (IK) model: `(target_Z_lift, target_base_pitch, target_base_roll) -> (L16A_len, L16B_len, L16C_len)`.
    -   The Execution Router sends the target Z/Pitch/Roll to this node/logic.
-   **Head Servos (Yaw, Pitch, Roll):**
    -   Direct mapping: Abstract target angles (radians or degrees) are sent to the `dynamixel_interface_node`.
-   **Movement Profiles (Phase 1 Basic):**
    -   The Execution Router will generate a simple time-based interpolation (e.g., linear or a basic ease-in/out if `speed_profile` is specified) from current position to target position over the `duration_estimate_ms`.
    -   It then sends intermediate setpoints to the Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) nodes at its own control frequency (e.g., 50Hz).

## 7. Constraint Checking (Phase 1)

-   **Joint Limits:** Before sending any command to Hardware Interface Layer (HIL), check against pre-configured absolute min/max limits for each servo angle and L16 actuator length. Clamp if exceeded.
-   **Velocity/Acceleration:** Phase 1 will rely on setting moderate overall speeds/durations in the cloud directives and simple interpolation locally. Advanced local velocity/acceleration profile generation and limiting is Phase 2.

## 8. ROS 2 Humble Interface (`a2_execution` package)

### 8.1. Subscriptions

-   `/shared_state/local_cache/active_directives` (`a2_interfaces/ActiveDirectivesForExecution`)
-   `/reflex/commands` (`a2_interfaces/CloudMotionCommand`)
-   `/teensy/p0_emergency_event` (`a2_interfaces/P0EmergencyEvent`)
-   (Potentially) `/local_shared_state_cache/cloud_sync_status` to know if it should engage fallback behaviors.

### 8.2. Publishers

-   To `l16_control_node` (or its input topics like `/l16/command/z_lift_mm`, etc.)
-   To `dynamixel_interface_node` (e.g., `/dynamixel/command_position/[joint_name]`, `/dynamixel/torque_enable`)
-   `/execution_router/status` (`a2_interfaces/ExecutionRouterStatus`)

## 9. Feedback and Monitoring (Phase 1)

-   The Execution Router primarily acts on commands. It does not directly close a feedback loop with low-level sensor data in Phase 1 (that's the role of Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) servo controllers or Teensy 4.1 L16 PID if it were doing that).
-   It relies on the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) being updated with actual physical state. The cloud LLMs (especially Motion Large Language Model (LLM)) would be responsible for comparing desired vs. actual (from Master Shared State System (MSSS) via Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)) and issuing corrections in subsequent directives if needed.
-   The `/execution_router/status` primarily reports which command it *thinks* it's executing.

## 10. Testing (Phase 1)

-   Unit tests for priority queue logic and P0/P1 preemption.
-   Test kinematic translation for neck base and head servos with mock inputs; verify correct target values sent to Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) topics.
-   Test joint limit clamping.
-   Integration test: Send a P2 command via Local Shared State Cache (LSSC), then trigger a P1 reflex; verify P1 executes and P2 is paused/cancelled. Then trigger P0; verify all stop.
-   Test fallback to "local_idle_pattern" when Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) indicates cloud disconnect.

The Phase 1 Execution Router focuses on correctly prioritizing and dispatching commands from different sources, ensuring safety, and executing basic kinematic translations for the A2 head/neck assembly. More nuanced motion control and blending are deferred.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Local Fast Path Reflex System (Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS)) is an onboard software component running on the A2 Robot's Raspberry Pi 5. It provides rapid, autonomous reactions to specific environmental stimuli or internal state changes, operating with a higher priority (P1) than cloud-derived task commands but lower than the Teensy 4.1's Ultra-Fast Safety Layer (P0).

The primary purposes of the Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) are:
-   To enhance the robot's safety and robustness by enabling quick, localized responses to immediate conditions.
-   To improve perceived responsiveness by handling certain interactions without the latency of a cloud round-trip.
-   To offload the cloud LLMs from needing to micromanage very basic, predictable reactions.
-   To provide a layer of autonomous behavior that can function even if cloud connectivity is temporarily degraded.

## 2. Architectural Placement and Responsibilities

-   **Location:** Runs as one or more ROS 2 Humble nodes on the Raspberry Pi 5, likely within an `a2_reflex_system` package.
-   **Inputs:**
    -   Subscribes to relevant processed sensor data from the `Local Shared State Cache (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC))` or directly from sensor processing nodes (e.g., `/local_perception_state/vision_detections_3d`, `/local_robot_physical_state/imu_base`, `/local_perception_state/audio_doa_local`).
    -   May also receive specific trigger events from other local nodes.
-   **Outputs:**
    -   Publishes `MotionCommand` messages (or a similar type defined in `a2_interfaces`) to a dedicated topic like `/reflex/commands`. The `Execution Router` subscribes to this topic and prioritizes these as P1 commands.
    -   May publish status updates or event notifications to the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) (e.g., `/reflex_system/status`, `/reflex_system/event_triggered`).
-   **Core Responsibilities:**
    1.  **Stimulus Monitoring:** Continuously monitor specific sensor data streams and Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) state variables for predefined trigger conditions.
    2.  **Condition Evaluation:** Apply simple to moderately complex logic to determine if a reflex should be triggered.
    3.  **Reflex Action Generation:** Formulate an appropriate, predefined reflexive `MotionCommand` (e.g., a quick head turn, a slight yield motion).
    4.  **Priority Management:** Ensure its output commands are correctly flagged for P1 execution.
    5.  **Short-Term State:** Maintain minimal internal state if needed for a reflex (e.g., to avoid continuous re-triggering of the same reflex).

## 3. Designed Reflexes (Examples)

The Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) will be composed of several independent or coordinated reflex modules. Here are some initial examples:

### 3.1. Proximal Object Reflex (Visual/Depth Based)

-   **Trigger Condition:** A 3D object (from `/local_perception_state/vision_detections_3d` or processed depth data) is detected within a critical proximity threshold (e.g., < 0.3m) in the robot's forward operational space, especially if it appears suddenly.
-   **Reflex Action:**
    -   Generate a `MotionCommand` for a slight, quick "yield" or "recoil" motion (e.g., small backward Z-lift of neck base, slight pitch up of head).
    -   Possibly a quick orient of the head/sensors towards the proximal object.
-   **Purpose:** Basic collision avoidance/mitigation, indicates awareness of immediate surroundings.
-   **Parameters (configurable):** Proximity threshold, yield magnitude, detection velocity threshold.

### 3.2. Sudden Loud Noise Orienting Reflex (Audio Based)

-   **Trigger Condition:** A loud sound event (above a certain dB threshold, from `/local_perception_state/audio_doa_local` or a dedicated loud sound detector) occurs from a direction significantly different from the robot's current head orientation.
-   **Reflex Action:**
    -   Generate a `MotionCommand` for a quick head/sensor orientation towards the estimated Direction of Arrival (DOA) of the sound.
    -   This is a saccade-like, fast motion.
-   **Purpose:** Mimics natural startle/orienting response, rapidly focuses sensors on potential new points of interest.
-   **Parameters:** Sound dB threshold, DOA difference threshold, orienting speed.

### 3.3. Base Instability Reflex (Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Based)

-   **Trigger Condition:** The base/torso Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) (from `/local_robot_physical_state/imu_base` via Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)) reports a sudden significant tilt, acceleration, or angular velocity exceeding predefined stability thresholds (e.g., indicative of being pushed or nearing a tipping point).
-   **Reflex Action:**
    -   Generate `MotionCommand`(s) for the neck mechanism to counteract the instability (e.g., shift head mass, adjust neck base actuators if they can influence CoG significantly and quickly). This is more limited for a head/neck assembly but could involve trying to "tuck" or achieve a neutral safe pose.
    -   If the robot had a mobile base, this reflex would be much more involved (e.g., adjusting leg/wheel positions).
-   **Purpose:** Attempt to maintain or regain stability, prevent falls.
-   **Parameters:** Tilt/acceleration/velocity thresholds, counter-motion parameters.

### 3.4. Touch/Force Reflex (If Applicable Sensors Exist)

-   **Trigger Condition:** If the robot has touch or force sensors (e.g., on its shell) and a threshold is exceeded.
-   **Reflex Action:**
    -   Yield motion away from the point of contact.
    -   Orient towards the touch source.
-   **Purpose:** Respond to physical interaction, prevent damage.
-   **Parameters:** Force/pressure threshold.

### 3.5. Lost Tracked Target Re-acquisition Reflex (Visual/Attention Based)

-   **Trigger Condition:** If the Decision Large Language Model (LLM) (via Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) `cached_cloud_context`) indicates a primary attention target (e.g., a user's face), and local vision (`/local_perception_state/vision_detections_3d`) loses track of this target for a brief period.
-   **Reflex Action:**
    -   Generate a small, searching `MotionCommand` (e.g., a small circular or pattern head movement around the last known target position).
-   **Purpose:** Attempt to quickly re-acquire a lost visual target without needing immediate cloud intervention.
-   **Parameters:** Timeout for lost track, search pattern definition, search area size.

## 4. Reflex Module Design

Each reflex can be implemented as a small, independent state machine or logic block within the Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) node(s).

-   **Input Processing:** Each module subscribes to specific Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) data.
-   **State:**
    -   `IDLE`: Waiting for trigger.
    -   `TRIGGERED`: Condition met, action initiated.
    -   `ACTIVE`: Reflex action being executed.
    -   `COOLDOWN`: Prevents immediate re-triggering after action completion.
-   **Output Generation:** When `TRIGGERED`, formulates and publishes the `MotionCommand` to `/reflex/commands`.
-   **Configuration:** Reflex parameters (thresholds, magnitudes, durations) should be configurable via ROS parameters for tuning.

## 5. Interaction with Execution Router

-   The `Execution Router` subscribes to `/reflex/commands`.
-   Commands received on this topic are assigned P1 (Software Reflex / Stability) priority.
-   The `Execution Router` will attempt to execute these P1 commands, potentially preempting or blending them with lower-priority P2 (Task) and P3 (Expressive) commands from the cloud (via Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)).
-   For example, if the robot is performing a P2 "look at user" task, and a P1 "proximal object reflex" is triggered to its right, the `Execution Router` might blend these to make the robot look at the user while slightly recoiling or tilting away from the object. If the P1 reflex is strong, it might fully interrupt the P2 task.

## 6. Coordination with Cloud Intelligence

-   The Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) operates largely independently for speed.
-   However, when a reflex is triggered, the Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) should also publish an event to the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) (e.g., `/reflex_system/event_triggered` with details of the reflex).
-   The `Cloud Gateway Node` can then pick up this event and send it to the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   This allows the cloud Decision Large Language Model (LLM) to become aware of the reflex action and incorporate it into its broader situation assessment and future planning (e.g., "The robot reflexively avoided an obstacle; I should re-plan its path or investigate the obstacle."). This closes the loop between fast local reactions and slower, more deliberate cloud-based reasoning.

## 7. ROS 2 Humble Node Structure (`a2_reflex_system` package)

-   A single `fast_path_reflex_node` could manage all reflexes if they are simple.
-   Alternatively, multiple nodes, each dedicated to a specific reflex type (e.g., `visual_reflex_node`, `imu_stability_reflex_node`), could offer better modularity. This is preferred for clarity.

### Example Node: `visual_proximity_reflex_node`

#### Subscriptions:
-   `/local_perception_state/vision_detections_3d` (or processed depth)
-   `/shared_state/local_cache/physical_state` (for current robot pose to assess relative object positions)
#### Publishers:
-   `/reflex/commands` (`a2_interfaces/CloudMotionCommand` - using this type for consistency, but it's a local command)
-   `/reflex_system/event_triggered` (`a2_interfaces/ReflexEvent`)
#### Parameters:
-   `proximity_threshold_m`
-   `yield_distance_mm`
-   `cooldown_period_s`

## 8. Testing and Tuning

-   Each reflex module needs to be tested in isolation by simulating its trigger conditions.
-   Integration testing with the `Execution Router` is crucial to verify correct prioritization and blending.
-   Extensive tuning of thresholds, action magnitudes, and cooldown periods will be required in a real-world environment to achieve effective and non-annoying reflexive behavior.
-   Test that reflex events are correctly reported to Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) and subsequently to the Master Shared State System (MSSS).

The Local Fast Path Reflex System adds a vital layer of responsiveness and survivability to the A2 robot, enabling it to react intelligently to its immediate environment much faster than relying solely on cloud processing.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document details the ROS 2 Humble nodes and processes running on the A2 Robot's Raspberry Pi 5 that are responsible for intermediate sensor data processing and fusion. These components take raw or minimally processed data published by the Hardware Interface Layer (Hardware Interface Layer (HIL)) nodes and transform it into more abstract, useful information for consumption by the Local Shared State Cache (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)), the Local Fast Path Reflex System (Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS)), and the Cloud Gateway Node.

The primary purposes of this layer are:
-   To perform sensor fusion (e.g., combining Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and other sensor data for robust pose estimation).
-   To extract meaningful features or events from sensor streams (e.g., detecting specific sound patterns, identifying immediate obstacles from depth data).
-   To convert sensor data into common coordinate frames or standardized formats.
-   To offload some processing from the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) or the Cloud Gateway, providing them with cleaner, more informative inputs.
-   To bridge the gap between raw hardware data and the information needed for local decision-making (reflexes) and cloud context.

## 2. Architectural Placement

-   These processing nodes run on the Raspberry Pi 5.
-   They subscribe to topics published by Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) nodes (e.g., `a2_teensy_interface_node`, `realsense2_camera_node`, `respeaker_ros_node`).
-   They publish their processed outputs to new ROS 2 Humble topics, which are then typically consumed by the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC), Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS), or `Cloud Gateway Node`.
-   These nodes are distinct from the advanced perception tasks running on the local RTX 4080 system (like YOLO object detection or full Speech-to-Text (STT)), although they might consume some simpler outputs from the Raspberry Pi 5 Camera if it were used for basic tasks.

## 3. Key Sensor Processing Modules/Nodes

### 3.1. Robot Pose Estimation / Localization Module

-   **Purpose:** To provide a stable and accurate estimate of the robot's head and/or base orientation and potentially its position in a local frame (odom).
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Utilizes the standard ROS 2 Humble `robot_localization` package, configured with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) nodes.
    -   **Node Name Example:** `ekf_local_filter_node`
-   **Inputs (Subscriptions):**
    -   `/teensy/imu/head_raw` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`): Provides head orientation and acceleration.
    -   `/teensy/imu/base_raw` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`): Provides base orientation and acceleration.
    -   Potentially other sources if available (e.g., visual odometry from Intel RealSense D455 if `rtabmap_ros` or similar is run, though this might be on the RTX 4080 system).
    -   Actuator feedback (e.g., from `/teensy/l16_feedback` and `/dynamixel/joint_states`) can be used to construct a kinematic model that informs the EKF about how internal movements affect the base or head pose.

                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Apply temporal smoothing
        if (!previous_depth_.empty()) {
            cv::addWeighted(fused_depth, params_.temporal_alpha,

    };

    class ProximityFusionNode {
        void process_proximity_array(const ProximityArray& msg) {

            for (auto& reading : msg.readings) {
                filtered_distances_[reading.sensor_id].push_back(reading.distance);
                if (filtered_distances_[reading.sensor_id].size() > filter_window_) {
                    filtered_distances_[reading.sensor_id].pop_front();
                }
            }

            // Generate 360° proximity map
            ProximityMap map;
            map.header.stamp = this->now();
            map.resolution = 10.0;  // degrees per sector

            for (int angle = 0; angle < 360; angle += map.resolution) {

            proximity_map_pub_->publish(map);
            check_collision_warnings(map);
        }
    };
```python

### 3.6. Audio Event Detector / DOA Enhancer (Optional)

-   **Purpose:** To process raw audio or basic DOA from the ReSpeaker array to detect specific types of sound events or refine DOA before it goes to Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)/Cloud.
-   **Implementation:** Custom Python ROS 2 Humble node.
    -   **Node Name Example:** `audio_event_processor_node`
-   **Inputs (Subscriptions):**
    -   `/audio/raw_mic_array_data` (if processing raw audio) or `/audio/doa_estimate` (if enhancing existing DOA).
-   **Processing:**
    -   If raw audio: Apply filters, run simple classifiers for sounds like "loud clap," "sharp impact," "voice activity."
    -   If basic DOA: Filter DOA estimates, correlate with energy levels, improve stability of the estimate.
-   **Outputs (Publishers):**
    -   `/audio/processed_doa` (`a2_interfaces/DirectionOfArrivalEstimate` - custom message with confidence, stability).
    -   `/audio/detected_events` (`std_msgs/String` - e.g., "LOUD_CLAP_DETECTED").
-   **Consumed by:** Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) (for `local_perception_state`), Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) (for Sudden Loud Noise Orienting Reflex).

### 3.7. Kinematic State Publisher (TF2 Broadcaster)

-   **Purpose:** To publish the TF2 transforms representing the robot's kinematic chain based on joint states. This is essential for ROS to understand where different parts of the robot are in relation to each other and the world.
-   **Implementation:** Often integrated within the `robot_state_publisher` standard ROS 2 Humble package, or a custom node if more complex logic is needed.
-   **Inputs (Subscriptions):**

## 4. Multi-Sensor Fusion Data Flow

### 4.1. I2C Multiplexer Coordination

The TCA9548A TCA9548A I2C multiplexer requires careful coordination to prevent bus conflicts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5 I2C Bus] --> B[TCA9548A Multiplexer 0x70]
    B --> C[Channel 0: Head Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) 0x69]
    B --> D[Channel 1: Base Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) 0x68]
    B --> E[Channel 2: Arducam Time-of-Flight (ToF) 0x08]
    B --> F[Channel 3: VL53L0X Front 0x30]
    B --> G[Channel 4: VL53L0X Back 0x31]
    B --> H[Channel 5: VL53L0X Left 0x32]
    B --> I[Channel 6: VL53L0X Right 0x33]
    B --> J[Channel 7: INA219 Array 0x40-0x45]
```

### 4.2. Sensor Reading Schedule

To maximize throughput while preventing conflicts:

 | Sensor Type | Update Rate | Channel Switch Time | Processing Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | ICM-20948 IMUs | 100 Hz | 1ms | 2ms |
 | VL53L0X Array | 50 Hz | 1ms | 1ms per sensor |
 | Arducam Time-of-Flight (ToF) | 30 Hz | 1ms | 5ms |
 | INA219 Array | 10 Hz | 1ms | 3ms |

### 4.3. Fusion Pipeline Architecture

```cpp
class SensorFusionPipeline {
public:
    void initialize() {
        // Initialize TCA9548A I2C multiplexer
        i2c_manager_ = std::make_shared<I2CSensorManager>();

        // Initialize fusion nodes
        depth_fusion_ = std::make_shared<DepthFusionNode>();
        proximity_fusion_ = std::make_shared<ProximityFusionNode>();
        pose_estimator_ = std::make_shared<PoseEstimationNode>();

        // Set up data flow
        setup_data_flow();
    }

private:
    void setup_data_flow() {
        // I2C Manager -> Fusion Nodes
        i2c_manager_->register_callback("imu_data",
            this { pose_estimator_->process_imu(data); });

        i2c_manager_->register_callback("proximity_data",
            this { proximity_fusion_->process_array(data); });

        i2c_manager_->register_callback("tof_data",
            this { depth_fusion_->process_tof(data); });

        // Cross-sensor fusion
        depth_fusion_->register_callback("fused_depth",
            this { obstacle_detector_->process_depth(data); });
    }
};
```python

### 4.4. Error Handling and Recovery

```cpp
class SensorErrorHandler {
public:
    enum SensorStatus {
        HEALTHY,
        DEGRADED,
        FAILED,
        RECOVERING
    };

    void handle_sensor_failure(uint8_t channel, const std::string& error) {
        sensor_status_[channel] = FAILED;

        switch (channel) {
            case HEAD_IMU:
                // Fall back to base Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for orientation
                enable_fallback_orientation();
                break;
            case ARDUCAM_TOF:
                // Use Intel RealSense D455 only for depth
                depth_fusion_->disable_tof_input();
                break;
            case VL53L0X_FRONT:
                // Increase reliance on other proximity sensors
                proximity_fusion_->compensate_for_failed_sensor(FRONT);
                break;
        }

        // Schedule recovery attempt
        schedule_recovery(channel);
    }

private:
    std::map<uint8_t, SensorStatus> sensor_status_;
    rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr recovery_timer_;
};
```

### 4.5. Performance Optimization

- **Parallel Processing**: Use separate threads for each fusion algorithm
- **Memory Management**: Pre-allocate buffers for sensor data
- **Cache Efficiency**: Minimize memory allocations in real-time loops
- **Priority Scheduling**: Higher priority for safety-critical sensors (proximity, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU))

## 5. General Considerations

-   **Performance on Raspberry Pi 5:** These nodes must be lightweight and efficient. C++ is preferred for computationally intensive tasks, but well-optimized Python can also work.
-   **Parameterization:** All thresholds, filter coefficients, and operational parameters should be configurable via ROS parameters.
-   **Diagnostics:** Nodes should publish diagnostics regarding their processing rates and status.
-   **Coordinate Frames:** Adherence to ROS REP 105 (Coordinate Frames for Mobile Platforms) and REP 103 (Standard Units of Measure) is crucial. All processed data should be in well-defined coordinate frames (e.g., `base_link`, `head_link`, `odom`).

## 6. Integration with Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) and Other Systems

-   The outputs of these local sensor processing nodes populate the `local_perception_state` and parts of `local_robot_physical_state` within the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   The Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) directly consumes outputs like `/perception/immediate_obstacles` and `/audio/processed_doa`.
-   The `Cloud Gateway Node` subscribes to these processed topics (via Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) or directly) to gather concise, relevant information to send to the cloud, rather than sending voluminous raw sensor data.

This local sensor processing layer ensures that the data fed into the robot's higher-level decision-making (both local reflexes and cloud LLMs) is refined, relevant, and in a usable format, contributing to overall system efficiency and responsiveness.

## 1. Introduction

In the A2 Robot's hybrid cloud-local architecture, the onboard NVIDIA RTX 4080 system GPU serves a critical role in processing tasks that benefit from significant local compute power but do not necessitate the full scale of cloud-based LLMs or can provide lower-latency advantages compared to a full cloud round-trip for certain interactive features.

This document outlines the primary services and responsibilities designated to the local RTX 4080 system. These services will typically run as Dockerized applications and/or ROS 2 Humble nodes, managed within the A2's onboard system.

## 2. Guiding Principles for RTX 4080 system Task Allocation

Tasks are assigned to the local RTX 4080 system based on:
-   **Latency Sensitivity:** Operations where sub-second or near real-time GPU-accelerated results significantly enhance user interaction or system responsiveness (e.g., visual perception feeding into local reflexes or fast user feedback).
-   **Data Locality/Bandwidth:** Processing large data streams (like raw video) locally to avoid high bandwidth costs or latency of uploading to the cloud for processing.
-   **Intermediate Complexity:** Tasks more complex than what the Raspberry Pi 5 can handle efficiently, but perhaps not requiring the full reasoning power (or cost) of large cloud-hosted LLMs.
-   **System Resilience:** Providing a level of local intelligence or feedback even if cloud connectivity is temporarily degraded (though full Large Language Model (LLM) functionality would be lost).

## 3. Core Services Hosted on Local RTX 4080 system

### 3.1. Advanced Computer Vision Processing

-   **Responsibility:** Perform real-time analysis of visual data from the RealSense D455 camera.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   ROS 2 Humble nodes (e.g., within the `a2_vision` package).
    -   GPU-accelerated libraries (e.g., OpenCV with CUDA, PyTorch/TensorFlow with TensorRT optimization).
-   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Object Detection & Tracking:**
        -   **Model:** YOLO-NAS, YOLOv8, or similar, fine-tuned for relevant objects (people, faces, hands, key environmental items).
        -   **Output:** Bounding boxes, class labels, confidence scores, and unique track IDs for detected objects. Published to local ROS topics (e.g., `/vision/detections`).
    2.  **Human Pose Estimation:**
        -   Models like OpenPose, MediaPipe Pose, or NVIDIA's Tao-toolkit pre-trained models.
        -   **Output:** Keypoints for human figures. Published to `/vision/human_poses`.
    3.  **Gesture Recognition (Visual):**
        -   Potentially a dedicated model or logic built upon pose estimation/hand tracking to recognize static or dynamic gestures.
        -   **Output:** Recognized gestures (e.g., wave, point). Published to `/vision/gestures`.
    4.  **Depth Data Processing:**
        -   Enhanced processing of Intel RealSense D455 depth streams, such as creating local 3D occupancy maps or segmenting the scene for obstacle avoidance beyond basic Fast Path reflexes.
        -   **Output:** Processed point clouds, obstacle maps. Published to `/vision/processed_depth`.
-   **Data Flow:** Raw image/depth streams from the Intel RealSense D455 (interfaced by Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5) are routed to the RTX 4080 system for processing. Results are published back to the local ROS 2 Humble network for consumption by the `Cloud Gateway` (for cloud Large Language Model (LLM) context), local `Shared State Cache`, or Fast Path reflex system.

### 3.2. Telemetry and Diagnostics Web Interface

-   **Responsibility:** Provide a rich, real-time web-based interface for monitoring robot status, sensor data, internal metrics, and potentially low-level control overrides for debugging and development.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   A web server application (e.g., FastAPI or Flask with WebSockets) running in a Docker container on the RTX 4080 system (which usually has a full OS).
    -   This application subscribes to a wide range of local ROS 2 Humble topics (via `rclpy` or a ROS-bridge solution if the web app is not a direct ROS node).
-   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Live Data Visualization:** Plotting sensor readings, robot pose, Large Language Model (LLM) (proxy) status, network status, local compute utilization (CPU, GPU, VRAM on the 4080).
    2.  **Video Streams:** Displaying RGB and Depth feeds from the Intel RealSense D455.
    3.  **Interactive Controls (for Debugging):** Buttons/sliders to trigger specific actions or override certain parameters (use with caution).
    4.  **Log Viewer:** Access to ROS 2 Humble logs and application logs.
    5.  **State Inspector:** View contents of the local Shared State cache.
-   **Benefit:** Leverages the RTX 4080 system's general compute capability (CPU side) and allows for a more graphically intensive UI than the Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5 might comfortably serve alongside its other duties. The GPU itself isn't heavily used by the UI, but the system hosting the 4080 has the resources.

### 3.3. (Potential) Local Speech-to-Text (Speech-to-Text (STT))

-   **Responsibility:** Transcribe user speech captured by the onboard microphone array (e.g., ReSpeaker Universal Serial Bus (USB) Array v2).
-   **Implementation:**
    -   A GPU-accelerated Speech-to-Text (STT) model like Whisper (medium or small variant) running in a Docker container.
    -   ROS 2 Humble node in `a2_audio` (or a dedicated `a2_stt` package) to manage the Speech-to-Text (STT) engine.
-   **Rationale for Local Speech-to-Text (STT):**
    -   **Lower Latency:** Transcribing locally can be faster than streaming raw audio to a cloud Speech-to-Text (STT) service and waiting for the text. This is crucial for responsive dialogue.
    -   **Reduced Bandwidth:** Avoids sending continuous raw audio to the cloud.
    -   **Offline Capability (Limited):** If cloud connectivity is lost, local Speech-to-Text (STT) could still allow for basic voice command understanding if a very small local command-parser Large Language Model (LLM) is also present (future consideration).
-   **Data Flow:** Raw audio from the mic array (interfaced by Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5) is sent to the Speech-to-Text (STT) service on the RTX 4080 system. The resulting text is published to `/audio/speech_to_text/transcription` for use by the `Cloud Gateway` (to send to cloud Communication Large Language Model (LLM)) and potentially local reactive behaviors.
-   **Consideration:** If the local RTX 4080 system VRAM becomes too constrained by vision tasks, a CPU-based Speech-to-Text (STT) on the Raspberry Pi 5 or a faster cloud Speech-to-Text (STT) might be reconsidered. However, Whisper benefits significantly from GPU.

## 4. Resource Management and Constraints

-   **VRAM:** The RTX 4080 system (typically 16GB or 24GB for consumer versions) VRAM must be shared between all local GPU tasks. Model quantization and efficient memory management are essential.
    -   Example: Vision models (YOLO, Pose) might take 2-6GB. Whisper (medium) might take 2-5GB. This leaves headroom but needs careful monitoring.
-   **GPU Compute Utilization:** Task scheduling and prioritization might be needed if multiple GPU tasks run concurrently.
-   **Inter-Process Communication:** Efficiently moving data between the Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5 (where sensors/actuators are often directly interfaced) and the system hosting the RTX 4080 system (if they are separate physical machines, though in your case the 4080 might be on a "main PC" that the Raspberry Pi 5 talks to over LAN) is key. If the RTX 4080 system is on a separate machine from the Raspberry Pi 5, high-speed networking (Gigabit Ethernet) is essential. If the "Local RTX 4080 system" means a PC that the Raspberry Pi 5 is networked to, this is fine.

## 5. Interaction with Other System Components

-   **Raspberry Pi 5:**
    -   Sends raw sensor data (camera, audio) to the RTX 4080 system for processing.
    -   Receives processed perception data (detections, text) from the RTX 4080 system via ROS 2 Humble topics.
    -   Hosts the `Cloud Gateway` which consumes some of this processed data.
-   **Cloud Gateway:**
    -   Takes outputs from local vision and Speech-to-Text (STT) (running on the RTX 4080 system) and sends them as context to the cloud LLMs.
-   **Execution Router (on Raspberry Pi 5):**
    -   May receive very low-latency inputs from local perception (e.g., a fast visual reflex if something suddenly appears close), though primary directives come from the cloud LLMs via the Gateway.

## 6. Future Enhancements for Local RTX 4080 system

-   **More Sophisticated Local Reflexes:** Running smaller, specialized "reflex" NNs on the 4080 that can react faster than a full cloud round-trip, based on local perception.
-   **Local Environment Mapping:** Building and updating a local 3D map of the immediate environment.
-   **On-the-fly Model Pruning/Swapping:** Dynamically adjusting which local models are active based on available VRAM and current task priorities.

By strategically assigning these intermediate-level AI and interface tasks to the local RTX 4080 system, the A2 robot can achieve a balance of sophisticated cloud intelligence and responsive local operation.

### Cloud Efficiency:

- **Spot Instances**: 70-90% cost savings for non-critical workloads
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale down during idle periods
- **Model Caching**: Avoid reload costs between sessions
- **Request Batching**: Group multiple requests when latency allows

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Local GPU Monitoring:

```python

# GPU utilization thresholds

VRAM_WARNING = 12GB    # 75% of 16GB
VRAM_CRITICAL = 14GB   # 87.5% of 16GB
TEMP_WARNING = 80°C
TEMP_CRITICAL = 85°C
POWER_WARNING = 280W
POWER_CRITICAL = 310W
```

### Cloud Cost Monitoring:

```python

# Cost thresholds

DAILY_WARNING = $40
DAILY_CRITICAL = $75
WEEKLY_WARNING = $200
WEEKLY_CRITICAL = $400
MONTHLY_CEILING = $1500
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Local Development Workflow:

1. **Start with local-only**: Develop using RTX 4080 system exclusively
2. **Profile resource usage**: Monitor VRAM, compute, and thermal
3. **Identify cloud candidates**: Tasks exceeding local capacity
4. **Implement cloud fallback**: Graceful degradation strategies
5. **Test hybrid operation**: Validate local-cloud coordination

### Production Deployment:

1. **Validate resource allocation**: Ensure local GPU not oversubscribed
2. **Configure auto-scaling**: Cloud instances scale with demand
3. **Set cost limits**: Hard stops to prevent runaway costs
4. **Monitor performance**: Track latency and quality metrics
5. **Plan capacity**: Anticipate peak usage scenarios

## Future Considerations

### Local GPU Upgrades:

- **RTX 5080**: Potential 24GB VRAM upgrade path
- **Multiple GPUs**: Dedicated cards for vision vs Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Edge TPUs**: Specialized inference accelerators

### Cloud Evolution:

- **Serverless GPU**: Pay-per-inference pricing models
- **Edge Deployment**: Regional GPU instances for lower latency
- **Custom Silicon**: Specialized AI chips for specific workloads

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Cloud Gateway Node is a key component within the A2 Robot's hybrid cloud-local architecture. It serves as the primary interface between the robot's onboard systems (running on the Raspberry Pi 5 and Teensy 4.1) and the cloud-hosted services (Multi-Large Language Model (LLM) Swarm, Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS), Master Shared State System - Master Shared State System (MSSS)) running on platforms like RunPod.

Its main purposes are:
-   To abstract the complexities of network communication with cloud services from other local ROS 2 Humble nodes.
-   To manage the flow of data (state, sensor information, commands, text, audio streams) between the robot and the cloud.
-   To ensure secure, reliable, and efficient communication.
-   To handle Application Programming Interface (API) interactions, including authentication, request formatting, response parsing, and error management.
-   To facilitate the synchronization of the local Shared State Cache (Local Shared State Cache (LSSC)) with the Master Shared State System (MSSS) in the cloud.

This node will run on the Raspberry Pi 5.

### 1.1. Phase 1 Implementation Scope

For Phase 1 (Essential Core), as detailed in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`, the Cloud Gateway Node will focus on core functionality with specific simplifications:

-   **Communication Protocol:** Will use HTTPS for Application Programming Interface (API) calls. Initial implementation will rely on polling for receiving directives from the Master Shared State System (MSSS). Push mechanisms (WebSockets/gRPC) are deferred.
-   **Data Marshalling:** JSON for Application Programming Interface (API) request/response bodies.
-   **Large Language Model (LLM) Interaction:** Will manage Application Programming Interface (API) calls to simplified or mock versions of the cloud LLMs and the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service.
-   **State Synchronization:** Will send curated local state summaries to the Master Shared State System (MSSS) and poll for resolved directives from the Master Shared State System (MSSS) to update the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   **Error Handling:** Basic error logging for network issues and Application Programming Interface (API) failures. Simple retry mechanisms (e.g., 2-3 attempts with fixed delay) for transient errors. Advanced circuit breakers and sophisticated offline behavior triggers are deferred.
-   **Security:** Management of Application Programming Interface (API) keys for cloud service authentication.

## 2. Architectural Placement and Responsibilities

-   **Location:** Runs as a ROS 2 Humble node on the Raspberry Pi 5, within the `a2_cloud_integration` package (new package to be created).
-   **Core Responsibilities:**
    1.  **Uplink Data Management:**
        -   Subscribes to relevant local ROS 2 Humble topics to gather curated data (e.g., summarized physical state from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC), Speech-to-Text (STT) results from local Speech-to-Text (STT) service on RTX 4080 system, specific event triggers).
        -   Formats this data into appropriate Application Programming Interface (API) request payloads for specific cloud services or for general Master Shared State System (MSSS) updates.
        -   Transmits data to update the Master Shared State System (MSSS) in the cloud (via `POST /robot/{robot_id}/state_from_gateway`).
        -   Sends contextual information and specific requests to cloud Large Language Model (LLM) APIs (e.g., `POST /communication/process_user_input`).
    2.  **Downlink Data Management:**
        -   Periodically polls the Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) (`GET /robot/{robot_id}/directives_for_robot`) for resolved directives intended for the robot.
        -   Receives streaming audio data from the cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service (initiated by a request it relays).
        -   Parses responses and publishes them onto appropriate local ROS 2 Humble topics for other onboard nodes (e.g., updates for Local Shared State Cache (LSSC), audio chunks for playback).
    3.  **Application Programming Interface (API) Interaction:**
        -   Manages HTTP/S requests to cloud Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints.
        -   Handles authentication (e.g., Application Programming Interface (API) keys in headers).
        -   Implements request/response serialization/deserialization (JSON).
    4.  **Network Management (Phase 1 Basic):**
        -   Monitors basic success/failure of Application Programming Interface (API) calls.
        -   Implements simple retry logic.
        -   Reports connectivity status to Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) (e.g., `cloud_sync_status.connectivity_to_cloud`).
    5.  **Security:**
        -   Ensures all communication to cloud services uses HTTPS.
        -   Manages Application Programming Interface (API) credentials securely (e.g., via ROS parameters loaded from environment variables or secure files).

## 3. ROS 2 Humble Interface

### 3.1. Subscriptions (Inputs to Cloud Gateway from local ROS network)

-   `/local_shared_state_cache/physical_state_summary_for_cloud` (`a2_interfaces/RobotPhysicalStateSummary`): A summarized version of robot state from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC), published at a controlled rate.
-   `/local_shared_state_cache/perception_summary_for_cloud` (`a2_interfaces/PerceptionSummary`): Summarized perception data from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   `/audio/speech_to_text/transcription` (`std_msgs/String`): Transcribed user speech from the local Speech-to-Text (STT) service (RTX 4080 system).
-   `/cloud_gateway/trigger_llm_request` (`a2_interfaces/TriggerCloudLLM`): Allows other local nodes to explicitly request the Gateway to send specific context to a cloud Large Language Model (LLM) (used for initiating interactions).
    *(This replaces the individual context topics from the previous draft with a single service-like trigger for clarity).*

### 3.2. Publishers (Outputs from Cloud Gateway to local ROS network)

-   `/shared_state/cloud_update_directives` (`a2_interfaces/ActiveDirectivesForExecution`): New directives polled from Master Shared State System (MSSS), destined for the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   `/shared_state/cloud_update_context` (`a2_interfaces/CloudContextFragment` - new message): Other relevant contextual updates from Master Shared State System (MSSS) (e.g., updated environment model summary) for Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   `/audio/play_stream_chunk` (`a2_interfaces/AudioStreamChunk`): Chunks of audio data received from cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM), for the local audio playback node.
-   `/cloud_gateway/status` (`diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticStatus`): Status of the gateway, including network connectivity (e.g., "CONNECTED_TO_CLOUD", "ERROR_MSS_UNREACHABLE", "ERROR_CSM_UNREACHABLE") and Application Programming Interface (API) call success/failure rates.

### 3.3. Service Clients (Used by Cloud Gateway to interact with local services - if any)

-   Generally, the Gateway subscribes to data. It might call local services if it needs to actively request a specific piece of information not regularly published. (Phase 1: Unlikely to need many service clients).

### 3.4. Actions (Provided or Used by Cloud Gateway)

-   Phase 1: No actions are planned for the Cloud Gateway itself. It operates on topics and direct Application Programming Interface (API) calls.

## 4. Interaction with Cloud Services (Phase 1 HTTP/S APIs)

All interactions are via RESTful APIs over HTTPS.

### 4.1. Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS))

-   **Update Master Shared State System (MSSS):**
    -   `POST https://[runpod_msss_endpoint]/robot/{robot_id}/state_from_gateway`
    -   Body: JSON payload with `RobotPhysicalStateSummary` and `PerceptionSummary`.
-   **Fetch Directives:**
    -   `GET https://[runpod_msss_endpoint]/robot/{robot_id}/directives_for_robot`
    -   Response: JSON payload matching `a2_interfaces/ActiveDirectivesForExecution` structure.

### 4.2. Cloud Communication Large Language Model (LLM)

-   **Process User Input / Get Response:**
    -   `POST https://[runpod_comm_llm_endpoint]/communication/process_user_input`
    -   Body: JSON payload as defined in `a2_communication_llm_cloud_interface.md` (e.g., `user_transcription`, `interactant_id`).
    -   Response: HTTP 202 Accepted, indicating processing initiated. Actual output via Master Shared State System (MSSS).

### 4.3. Cloud Decision Large Language Model (LLM)

-   **Trigger Re-evaluation (Optional/Less Frequent):**
    -   `POST https://[runpod_decision_llm_endpoint]/decision/re_evaluate_context`
    -   Body: JSON payload with critical event data.
    -   Response: HTTP 202 Accepted. Output via Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   (Note: Decision Large Language Model (LLM) primarily reacts to Master Shared State System (MSSS) state changes triggered by Gateway updates to Master Shared State System (MSSS) or other Large Language Model (LLM) outputs.)

### 4.4. Cloud Motion Large Language Model (LLM)

-   (Similar to Decision Large Language Model (LLM), primarily reacts to Master Shared State System (MSSS) state. Direct calls from Gateway are rare/deferred from Phase 1).

### 4.5. Cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) Service

-   **Generate Speech Stream:**
    -   `POST https://[runpod_csm_endpoint]/generate_speech_stream`
    -   Body: JSON payload (`text_to_speak`, `voice_id`, `output_format`). This request is triggered when the Gateway identifies a `speech_generation_request` in the directives polled from Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    -   Response: Streaming HTTP response with `Content-Type: audio/pcm` (or similar). The Gateway reads this stream chunk by chunk.

## 5. Data Formatting and Serialization

-   **Application Programming Interface (API) Payloads:** JSON.
-   **Audio Stream:** Raw PCM (e.g., 16-bit, 16kHz, mono) is the target for Phase 1 simplicity. The Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service will specify the exact format in its response headers or as a known parameter.

## 6. Error Handling and Resilience (Phase 1 Basic)

-   **Network Timeouts:** Standard HTTP client timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds for Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, longer for initial audio stream response).
-   **Retry Mechanisms:** For Application Programming Interface (API) calls to Master Shared State System (MSSS), LLMs, Conversational Speech Model (CSM): if a transient error (e.g., HTTP 503, timeout) occurs, retry 2-3 times with a short, fixed delay (e.g., 1-2 seconds). Log failures.
-   **Status Reporting:**
    -   If cloud services are consistently unreachable after retries, update `/cloud_gateway/status` to reflect "ERROR_SERVICE_UNREACHABLE".
    -   The Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) and Execution Router will observe this status to potentially trigger local fallback behaviors (e.g., the robot indicating it cannot reach its "brain" or perform complex tasks).
-   **Invalid Application Programming Interface (API) Responses:** Log errors if Application Programming Interface (API) responses are not in the expected format.

## 7. Security Considerations

-   **HTTPS:** Mandatory for all external communication.
-   **Application Programming Interface (API) Credentials:** Application Programming Interface (API) keys for RunPod services will be managed via environment variables set in the Docker container or ROS launch file parameters loaded from secure local files. Not hardcoded.
-   **Data Minimization:** The Gateway will only send summarized/curated data necessary for cloud processing.

## 8. Implementation Details

-   **Language:** Python.
-   **Key Python Libraries:** `rclpy`, `requests` (for synchronous HTTP calls in Phase 1), `json`. For streaming audio reception, `requests` with `stream=True` or `httpx` with streaming support.
-   **Threading/Async:** While full `aiohttp` might be Phase 2, handling the audio stream reception in a separate thread within the ROS node might be necessary in Phase 1 to avoid blocking the main ROS spin and other Application Programming Interface (API) calls.

## 9. Testing Strategy (for Cloud Gateway Node)

-   **Unit Tests:** For Application Programming Interface (API) request formatting, response parsing, internal logic for managing subscriptions/publications.
-   **Mocked Cloud Services:** Develop local mock FastAPI servers that mimic the Master Shared State System (MSSS), Large Language Model (LLM), and Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints. Test Gateway interaction with these mocks for:
    -   Correct data uplink.
    -   Correct polling and processing of directives.
    -   Correct handling of audio streaming from mock Conversational Speech Model (CSM).
    -   Basic retry logic on simulated errors.
-   **Integration with Local Shared State Cache (LSSC):** Verify that data polled from (mocked) Master Shared State System (MSSS) is correctly published by the Gateway and ingested by the Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
-   **Network Failure Simulation:** Use tools to simulate network down/unresponsive APIs and verify Gateway status reporting and retry behavior.

This Cloud Gateway Node is the linchpin for the hybrid architecture. Its Phase 1 implementation focuses on establishing the basic data flow and Application Programming Interface (API) interactions necessary for the initial end-to-end POCs.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Communication Large Language Model (LLM) is a cloud-hosted component of the A2 Robot's Multi-Large Language Model (LLM) Swarm. Its primary responsibility is to manage natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue generation, persona expression, and the coordination of speech with expressive gestures and behaviors. It operates within the cloud environment (e.g., RunPod) and interacts heavily with the Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS)) and the Conversational Speech Model (Conversational Speech Model (CSM)) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service.

This document defines:
-   How the Communication Large Language Model (LLM) retrieves context and inputs.
-   The structure of its outputs.
-   Its interaction with the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   Its Application Programming Interface (API) for receiving specific triggers or contextual updates from the A2 robot via the `Cloud Gateway`.
-   Its internal interaction with the cloud-based Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service.

### 1.1. Phase 1 Implementation Scope

For Phase 1 (Essential Core), as detailed in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`, the cloud-hosted Communication Large Language Model (LLM) will focus on core dialogue and expression capabilities with specific simplifications:

-   **Model:** Deployed using Mistral 7B Instruct base with a custom LoRA adapter for communication tasks. Initial LoRA training will focus on basic conversational ability and the robot's core persona.
-   **NLU/Dialogue Management:** Capable of understanding simple user intents and generating relevant text responses. Complex multi-turn dialogue tracking will be basic.
-   **Expression Generation:** Will generate directives for 1-2 simple, predefined expressive gestures (e.g., "nod," "slight head tilt") to accompany speech. Sophisticated or highly nuanced expressive behavior generation is deferred. Abstract facial expression directives may be placeholders initially.
-   **Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) Triggering:** Will reliably send its generated text to the cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service for speech synthesis.
-   **Master Shared State System (MSSS) Interaction:** Will publish its outputs to the Master Shared State System (MSSS) and read necessary context.
-   **Application Programming Interface (API):** Will expose the `POST /communication/process_user_input` endpoint for receiving transcribed user speech from the `Cloud Gateway`.
-   **Error Handling:** Basic logging of processing errors. Will attempt to generate a neutral or fallback response if context is insufficient or an error occurs.
-   **Persona:** A single, consistent persona will be implemented.

## 2. Architectural Placement and Core Responsibilities

-   **Hosting:** Runs as a containerized service in the cloud (e.g., RunPod).
-   **Key Responsibilities (Phase 1 Focus):**
    1.  **Basic NLU:** Interpreting transcribed user speech (received via Master Shared State System (MSSS) update from the robot's `Cloud Gateway` or direct Application Programming Interface (API) call).
    2.  **Simple Dialogue Management:** Maintaining context for short conversations.
    3.  **Text Response Generation:** Creating contextually relevant and persona-consistent text.
    4.  **Basic Expressive Behavior Formulation:** Generating directives for simple, predefined gestures.
    5.  **Triggering Conversational Speech Model (CSM):** Sending finalized text to the cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service.

## 3. Interaction with Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS))

The Communication Large Language Model (LLM) is a primary consumer and producer of state within the Master Shared State System (MSSS).

### 3.1. Consuming State from Master Shared State System (MSSS)

The Communication Large Language Model (LLM) regularly polls or subscribes to relevant sections of the Master Shared State System (MSSS) to gather context. For Phase 1, key consumed state includes:
-   `conversation_module_context`: Especially `dialogue_history_short_term` and `last_user_interpreted_intent`.
-   `environment_model`: Primarily `detected_persons` to identify the interactant.
-   `robot_internal_state_cloud`: `current_behavioral_mode` and `current_emotional_tone_directive` (from Decision Large Language Model (LLM)) to guide its response style.

### 3.2. Publishing Outputs to Master Shared State System (MSSS)

After processing, the Communication Large Language Model (LLM) publishes its structured output to the `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.communication_llm_output` section of the Master Shared State System (MSSS). This output will then be processed by the (simplified) Master Shared State System (MSSS) Conflict Resolution Engine.

**Illustrative Output Structure for Phase 1 (to be published to Master Shared State System (MSSS)):**
```json
{
  "timestamp_utc": "2025-05-17T10:02:00Z",
  "request_correlation_id": "req_xyz123", // ID from the input request if available
  "confidence_score_norm": 0.85, // Overall confidence in the generated response
  "nlu_results": {
      "processed_user_utterance": "Tell me about your sensors.",
      "detected_intent_label": "query_capabilities_sensors",
      "key_entities": [ /* {"entity_type": "topic", "value": "sensors"} */ ]
  },
  "dialogue_management_info":{
      "suggested_dialogue_act": "inform" // e.g. "inform", "question", "greet"
  },
  "response_text_for_speech": "I have a camera for seeing and microphones for hearing!", // Simpler response for Phase 1
  "desired_expressive_gestures_abstract": [ // Limited set for Phase 1
    { "gesture_id": "comm_gesture_nod_001", "type_label": "gentle_nod", "intensity_norm": 0.6, "timing_hint_relative_to_speech": "during_phrase_camera_for_seeing" }
  ],
  // "facial_expression_directive" can be omitted or very simple in Phase 1
  "updated_conversation_context_summary": { // For Master Shared State System (MSSS) to update the main conversation context
    "history_append_robot_turn": {
        "speaker": "A2",
        "text_generated": "I have a camera for seeing and microphones for hearing!"
        // Add timestamp once generated
    },
    "updated_active_topic": "robot_sensors_basic"
  }
}```
**Phase 1 Note:** The complexity of `desired_expressive_gestures_abstract` will be minimal, referring to a small library of predefined, simple gestures (e.g., "nod", "slight_tilt"). Rich, dynamically generated gestures are Phase 2.

## 4. Application Programming Interface (API) Exposed by Communication Large Language Model (LLM) Service

The Communication Large Language Model (LLM) exposes an Application Programming Interface (API) for the `Cloud Gateway` to submit new user input that requires processing.

### 4.1. Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/communication/process_user_input`

-   **Purpose:** Allows the `Cloud Gateway` to send new, transcribed user speech and minimal immediate context to the Communication Large Language Model (LLM) for processing.
-   **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "request_id": "req_xyz123", // Unique ID for tracking
      "user_transcription": "What are you working on right now?",
      "current_interactant_id": "person_1", // Optional, if known
      "timestamp_utc_gateway": "2025-05-17T10:01:00Z",
      "metadata": { // Optional, for additional context if needed in Phase 1
          "current_robot_behavioral_mode_hint": "idle"
      }
    }
```python
-   **Action by Communication Large Language Model (LLM):**
    1.  Receives this request.
    2.  Fetches necessary broader context from the Master Shared State System (MSSS) (e.g., recent dialogue history, current goals from Decision Large Language Model (LLM)).
    3.  Performs NLU, dialogue management, and generates its text response and basic expressive directives.
    4.  Publishes its comprehensive output (as per Section 3.2) to `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.communication_llm_output` in the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    5.  **Critically, it makes a direct internal cloud Application Programming Interface (API) call to the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service** with the `response_text_for_speech` (see Section 5).
-   **Response Body (JSON) - HTTP 202 Accepted:**
    ```json
    {
      "status_message": "Input received and processing initiated.",
      "msss_publish_pending": true,
      "csm_trigger_initiated": true,
      "request_correlation_id": "req_xyz123"
    }
    ```
    The actual robot response (speech, motion) is coordinated via Master Shared State System (MSSS) and subsequent actions by other components.

## 5. Interaction with Cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) Service

1.  **Trigger:** After the Communication Large Language Model (LLM) has formulated its `response_text_for_speech`.
2.  **Action:** The Communication Large Language Model (LLM) service makes a **direct internal Application Programming Interface (API) call** (within the cloud environment, e.g., service-to-service) to the cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service's `/generate_speech_stream` endpoint.
    -   **Payload to Conversational Speech Model (CSM) (Phase 1):**
        ```json
        {
          "text": "I have a camera for seeing and microphones for hearing!", // Text from its own output
          "voice_id": "a2_default_voice", // Single cloned voice for Phase 1
          "output_format": "pcm_s16le_16000_mono" // Target format for streaming
        }
        ```
3.  **Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Streaming to Robot:** The Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service then streams the audio directly to the `Cloud Gateway` on the robot, as detailed in `csm_tts_integration.md`. The Communication Large Language Model (LLM) does not handle the audio stream itself; it only initiates the Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation.
4.  **Coordination:** The text sent to Conversational Speech Model (CSM) must be identical to the `response_text_for_speech` field published to Master Shared State System (MSSS).

## 6. Operational Logic (Phase 1 Simplified)

1.  **Reactive to Application Programming Interface (API) Call:** Primarily waits for calls to its `/api/v1/communication/process_user_input` endpoint from the `Cloud Gateway`.
2.  **On New Input Request:**
    a.  Perform basic NLU on `user_transcription`.
    b.  Fetch minimal recent dialogue history and current behavioral mode from Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    c.  Generate a text response and select 1-2 simple, predefined expressive gestures.
    d.  Publish its output package to `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.communication_llm_output` in Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    e.  Simultaneously, send the `response_text_for_speech` to the cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service.
    f.  Return HTTP 202 to the `Cloud Gateway`.

## 7. Persona Management (Phase 1)

-   A single LoRA adapter defining the A2's core persona and basic conversational style will be used.
-   The focus is on achieving a consistent and recognizable interaction style, rather than dynamic persona switching.

## 8. Error Handling (Phase 1 Basic)

-   If Master Shared State System (MSSS) is briefly unreachable when fetching context, it may use a very limited context or generate a generic "I need a moment to process that" type of response. Log error.
-   If the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) service call fails, log the error. The text response is still published to Master Shared State System (MSSS); the robot will simply not speak for that turn. This failure should be queryable or logged in Master Shared State System (MSSS) if possible.
-   If its own Large Language Model (LLM) processing fails, attempt to return a graceful pre-defined error message for Text-to-Speech (TTS) (e.g., "I'm having a little trouble thinking right now.") or a silent failure indication to Master Shared State System (MSSS).

## 9. Security

-   The `/api/v1/communication/process_user_input` endpoint must be authenticated (e.g., requiring an Application Programming Interface (API) key known only to the `Cloud Gateway`).
-   Internal calls to Conversational Speech Model (CSM) should be on a private cloud network or use internal service authentication.

This Communication Large Language Model (LLM), even in its simplified Phase 1 form, is key to enabling the A2 robot's ability to engage in basic dialogue and trigger custom-voiced speech. Its outputs will drive both auditory and some visual expression.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Decision Large Language Model (LLM) is a central intelligent component within the A2 Robot's cloud-hosted Multi-Large Language Model (LLM) Swarm. Its primary function is to integrate multi-modal information from the robot's environment and internal state, perform high-level reasoning, set goals, manage attention, and generate overarching behavioral directives for other LLMs and the robot itself. It operates within the cloud environment (e.g., RunPod).

This document defines:
-   How the Decision Large Language Model (LLM) sources its contextual information, primarily from the Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS)).
-   The structure of its outputs (goals, directives, context updates) for Phase 1.
-   Its interaction with the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   Its minimal Application Programming Interface (API), as it's mainly reactive to Master Shared State System (MSSS) changes.

### 1.1. Phase 1 Implementation Scope

For Phase 1 (Essential Core), as detailed in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`, the cloud-hosted Decision Large Language Model (LLM) will implement a simplified set of its core responsibilities:

-   **Model:** Deployed using Mistral 7B Instruct base with a custom LoRA adapter focused on basic context integration and goal/behavioral mode selection.
-   **Context Integration:** Will process simplified summaries of `environment_model` (e.g., presence of a user), `conversation_module_context` (e.g., is a conversation active?), and `robot_internal_state_cloud` from the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   **Situation Assessment:** Basic assessment, e.g., "User present and speaking," "Idle," "Executing cloud task."
-   **Goal Management (Simplified):** Will set very high-level goals, such as "ENGAGE_USER" or "IDLE_OBSERVE." Complex goal decomposition or long-term planning is deferred. It will primarily manage one active goal at a time.
-   **Attention Direction (Simplified):** Will direct attention primarily to a detected user if present.
-   **Behavioral Mode Selection:** Will select from a small set of predefined behavioral modes (e.g., "INTERACTIVE_GREETING," "IDLE_NEUTRAL," "PROCESSING_TASK").
-   **Directive Generation:** Will issue simple, high-level directives to the Communication Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., "Adopt INTERACTIVE_GREETING tone") and the Motion Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., "Orient towards detected user," "Adopt NEUTRAL posture").
-   **Master Shared State System (MSSS) Interaction:** Will read from and publish its outputs to the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   **Application Programming Interface (API):** Minimal direct Application Programming Interface (API); primarily reacts to state changes in Master Shared State System (MSSS) that are updated by the `Cloud Gateway`.

## 2. Architectural Placement and Core Responsibilities

-   **Hosting:** Runs as a containerized service in the cloud (e.g., RunPod).
-   **Key Responsibilities (Phase 1 Focus):**
    1.  **Simplified Context Integration:** Processing key summaries from Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    2.  **Basic Situation Assessment:** Determining the robot's immediate operational context.
    3.  **Single Active Goal Setting:** Defining the robot's current primary high-level goal.
    4.  **Primary Attention Focus:** Directing attention (e.g., to a user).
    5.  **Basic Behavioral Mode Selection:** Choosing from a limited set of modes.
    6.  **High-Level Directive Generation:** Providing simple guidance to other LLMs via Master Shared State System (MSSS).

## 3. Interaction with Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS))

The Decision Large Language Model (LLM) relies heavily on the Master Shared State System (MSSS) for its inputs and publishes its conclusions back to the Master Shared State System (MSSS).

### 3.1. Consuming State from Master Shared State System (MSSS)

The Decision Large Language Model (LLM) continuously monitors or polls the Master Shared State System (MSSS) for updates. For Phase 1, key consumed state includes:
-   `environment_model`: Particularly `detected_persons` (to know if a user is present/interacting) and `significant_sound_events` (like speech detection).
-   `conversation_module_context`: `current_interactant_id`, `is_conversation_active` (a simplified flag).
-   `robot_internal_state_cloud`: Its own previously set `active_goals` and `current_behavioral_mode` to maintain consistency or decide on changes.
-   `cloud_system_status_monitoring.last_robot_gateway_heartbeat_utc`: To know if the robot is online.
-   (Optionally) Simplified outputs from other LLMs in `cloud_llm_pending_outputs` if it needs to react to their immediate proposals before its own cycle.

### 3.2. Publishing Outputs to Master Shared State System (MSSS)

The Decision Large Language Model (LLM) publishes its structured output to the `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.decision_llm_output` section of the Master Shared State System (MSSS). These outputs are then considered by the (simplified) Master Shared State System (MSSS) Conflict Resolution Engine.

**Illustrative Output Structure for Phase 1 (to be published to Master Shared State System (MSSS)):**
```json
{
  "timestamp_utc": "2025-05-17T10:05:00Z",
  "request_correlation_id": "trigger_event_abc", // If triggered by a specific event
  "confidence_score_norm": 0.80,
  "situation_assessment_label": "USER_PRESENT_AND_ENGAGING", // e.g., USER_PRESENT_IDLE, ROBOT_IDLE
  "active_goal_set": { // Phase 1: Likely a single primary goal
    "goal_id": "goal_user_interaction_001",
    "type_label": "MAINTAIN_USER_ENGAGEMENT",
    "target_id_if_applicable": "person_1", // From detected_persons
    "status_label": "active",
    "priority_level_highmedlow": "high"
  },
  "attention_directive_simple": { // Simplified for Phase 1
    "focus_target_id": "person_1",
    "focus_type_label": "PRIMARY_INTERACTANT"
  },
  "behavioral_mode_directive_label": "RESPONSIVE_INTERACTIVE", // From a predefined set
  "high_level_directives_for_communication_llm": {
    "suggested_persona_tone_label": "friendly_and_attentive",
    "request_greeting_if_new_interaction": true // Example flag
  },
  "high_level_directives_for_motion_llm": {
    "desired_general_posture_label": "attentive_upright",
    "orientation_target_preference_id": "person_1" // Suggests who/what to generally face
  }
}
```python
**Phase 1 Note:** Goal structures and directives are high-level and selected from a limited, predefined set. Complex planning or decomposition of goals is deferred.

## 4. Application Programming Interface (API) Exposed by Decision Large Language Model (LLM) Service

The Decision Large Language Model (LLM) primarily operates by reacting to changes in the Master Shared State System (MSSS). A direct Application Programming Interface (API) for the `Cloud Gateway` to call is generally not the main interaction pattern for this Large Language Model (LLM), as its decisions are based on a broader state. However, a "poke" or "hint" Application Programming Interface (API) could exist.

### 4.1. Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/decision/notify_critical_event` (Optional, for specific immediate triggers)

-   **Purpose:** Allows the `Cloud Gateway` to signal a highly critical and unexpected local event that might require immediate global reassessment by the Decision Large Language Model (LLM), potentially bypassing its normal polling cycle of Master Shared State System (MSSS) or providing a direct hint.
-   **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "event_id": "event_gateway_xyz789",
      "event_type_label": "POTENTIAL_LOCAL_EMERGENCY_OR_USER_INTERVENTION", // Abstracted critical event
      "event_data_summary_json": "{\"source\": \"local_safety_monitor\", \"details\": \"unexpected_force_detected_on_chassis\"}",
      "timestamp_utc_gateway": "2025-05-17T10:04:00Z"
    }
```python
-   **Action by Decision Large Language Model (LLM):**
    1.  Logs this critical event notification.
    2.  Immediately fetches the latest full context from Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    3.  Performs an urgent re-evaluation of goals, attention, and behavioral mode, potentially setting a "SAFE_MODE" or "ALERT_OPERATOR" goal.
    4.  Publishes its updated output to `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.decision_llm_output` in Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   **Response Body (JSON) - HTTP 202 Accepted:**
    ```json
    {
      "status_message": "Critical event notification received. Re-evaluation triggered.",
      "msss_publish_pending": true
    }
```python
-   **Phase 1 Note:** This endpoint may be deferred if all critical local events are handled by P0/P1 reflexes and reported to Master Shared State System (MSSS) through normal state updates from the Gateway. Its primary use would be for events that don't have a local reflex but need immediate high-level cognitive attention.

## 5. Operational Logic (Phase 1 Simplified)

1.  **Periodic Re-evaluation Loop (e.g., every 1-5 seconds, or triggered by significant Master Shared State System (MSSS) updates):**
    a.  Fetch relevant current state from Master Shared State System (MSSS) (summaries of environment, conversation, internal state).
    b.  Perform basic situation assessment (e.g., Is a user present? Is a conversation active? Is there a critical alert from the robot?).
    c.  **Goal Update:**
        -   If current context suggests a change from the current `active_goal_set.type_label` (e.g., user just appeared, current goal is "IDLE"), select a new appropriate high-level goal from a predefined list (e.g., "ENGAGE_USER").
        -   For Phase 1, manage only one primary active goal.
    d.  **Directive Formulation:** Based on the selected goal and current context, choose:
        -   An appropriate `behavioral_mode_directive_label`.
        -   A simple `attention_directive_simple`.
        -   Corresponding high-level directives for the Communication and Motion LLMs.
    e.  Publish the comprehensive output (as per Section 3.2) to `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.decision_llm_output` in Master Shared State System (MSSS).
2.  The (simplified) Master Shared State System (MSSS) Conflict Resolution Engine then processes this output.

## 6. Error Handling (Phase 1 Basic)

-   If Master Shared State System (MSSS) is unreachable when fetching context, the Decision Large Language Model (LLM) logs the error. It might maintain its last known set of directives or default to an "IDLE_UNCERTAIN" behavioral mode, publishing this state to Master Shared State System (MSSS) if possible.
-   If its own Large Language Model (LLM) processing fails, it should log the error and avoid publishing corrupted or empty data to Master Shared State System (MSSS). It could attempt to publish a "DECISION_LLM_ERROR" status.

## 7. Security

-   If the optional Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint is implemented, it must be authenticated.
-   All interactions with Master Shared State System (MSSS) are governed by Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) security.

The Phase 1 Decision Large Language Model (LLM) provides basic strategic oversight, ensuring the robot shifts between fundamental states like "idle" and "user engagement" and gives high-level guidance to the other more specialized LLMs. Its sophistication will grow in later phases.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Motion Large Language Model (LLM) is a specialized component within the A2 Robot's cloud-hosted Multi-Large Language Model (LLM) Swarm. Its primary role is to translate abstract behavioral and goal-oriented directives (often from the Decision Large Language Model (LLM), via Master Shared State System (MSSS)) and expressive needs (from the Communication Large Language Model (LLM), via Master Shared State System (MSSS)) into feasible, natural-looking, and physically constrained abstract motion plans. It operates within the cloud environment (e.g., RunPod).

This document defines:
-   How the Motion Large Language Model (LLM) sources its inputs, primarily from the Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS)).
-   The structure of its outputs (abstract motion plans) for Phase 1.
-   Its interaction with the Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   Its minimal Application Programming Interface (API), as it's largely reactive to Master Shared State System (MSSS) directives.

### 1.1. Phase 1 Implementation Scope

For Phase 1 (Essential Core), as detailed in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`, the cloud-hosted Motion Large Language Model (LLM) will implement a simplified version of its motion planning capabilities:

-   **Model:** Deployed using Mistral 7B Instruct base with a custom LoRA adapter focused on translating high-level pose/orientation directives and simple gesture requests into sequences of abstract motion primitives.
-   **Directive Interpretation:** Will understand a limited set of high-level motion goals from the Master Shared State System (MSSS), such as "orient head to target X," "adopt 'attentive' posture," "perform 'nod' gesture."
-   **Kinematic Planning (Abstract):** Will generate short sequences of abstract motion primitives (e.g., target head orientation, target neck base Z-lift). It will not deal with detailed joint angles or dynamics; this is left to the onboard `Execution Router`.
-   **Movement Quality:** Will aim for basic smoothness by specifying estimated durations and simple speed profiles (e.g., "linear," "ease_in_out") for its primitives. Highly nuanced biomimetic motion is deferred.
-   **Constraint Adherence (Abstract):** Will operate based on a simplified understanding of the robot's capabilities (e.g., "head can yaw +/- 180 degrees"). Detailed limit checking is done locally.
-   **Blending and Sequencing (Simplified):** For Phase 1, it will primarily generate one motion plan at a time in response to the highest priority directive from Master Shared State System (MSSS). Complex blending of multiple concurrent motion goals is deferred. Simple sequencing of primitives within a single plan is supported.
-   **Master Shared State System (MSSS) Interaction:** Will read directives from Master Shared State System (MSSS) and publish its abstract motion plans back to Master Shared State System (MSSS).
-   **Application Programming Interface (API):** Minimal direct Application Programming Interface (API); primarily reacts to state changes and directives in Master Shared State System (MSSS).

## 2. Architectural Placement and Core Responsibilities

-   **Hosting:** Runs as a containerized service in the cloud (e.g., RunPod).
-   **Key Responsibilities (Phase 1 Focus):**
    1.  **Interpreting Abstract Motion Directives:** Understanding high-level motion/posture/gesture requests from Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    2.  **Generating Sequences of Abstract Motion Primitives:** Creating a plan consisting of one or more steps (e.g., "first, orient yaw; then, adjust pitch").
    3.  **Basic Movement Quality Specification:** Assigning estimated durations and simple speed profiles to primitives.
    4.  **Providing Abstract Kinematic Targets:** Specifying desired end-states for the head orientation and neck base configuration in a robot-centric coordinate system.

## 3. Interaction with Master Shared State System (Master Shared State System (MSSS))

The Motion Large Language Model (LLM) relies on the Master Shared State System (MSSS) for its inputs and publishes its motion plans back to the Master Shared State System (MSSS).

### 3.1. Consuming State from Master Shared State System (MSSS)

The Motion Large Language Model (LLM) monitors the Master Shared State System (MSSS) for directives relevant to movement. For Phase 1, key consumed state includes:
-   `resolved_robot_directives_queue` (from previous cycle, or a dedicated section for "motion_relevant_directives_from_decision_comm_llms"): Specifically interested in `high_level_directives_for_motion_llm` from the Decision Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., posture style, orientation targets) and abstract `gesture_commands_abstract` or `expression_commands_abstract` that imply a physical motion.
-   `environment_model`: Simplified information about target locations (e.g., `detected_persons.estimated_position_world`) if a directive is "orient to person_1".
-   `robot_internal_state_cloud.current_behavioral_mode`: To potentially influence movement style (e.g., "INTERACTIVE" mode might imply slightly faster, more direct movements than "IDLE_OBSERVE").
-   A very simplified summary of the robot's current abstract pose if needed as a starting point for planning (e.g., `robot_current_abstract_head_orientation`).

### 3.2. Publishing Outputs to Master Shared State System (MSSS)

The Motion Large Language Model (LLM) publishes its structured output (abstract motion plans) to the `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.motion_llm_output` section of the Master Shared State System (MSSS). These plans are then considered by the (simplified) Master Shared State System (MSSS) Conflict Resolution Engine.

**Illustrative Output Structure for Phase 1 (to be published to Master Shared State System (MSSS)):**
```json
{
  "timestamp_utc": "2025-05-17T10:08:00Z",
  "request_correlation_id": "directive_id_abc", // ID of the input directive it's responding to
  "confidence_score_norm": 0.85,
  "motion_plan_id": "phase1_mp_001",
  "plan_comment": "Simple orientation to target and nod gesture.",
  "abstract_motion_primitives": [ // Sequence of abstract movements
    {
      "primitive_id": "p1_orient_yaw_001",
      "type_label": "SET_HEAD_YAW_RELATIVE", // Relative to robot base
      "target_value_rad": 0.2, // Example: 0.2 radians to the right
      "estimated_duration_ms": 300,
      "speed_profile_hint": "ease_in_out", // "linear", "ease_in_out"
      "blocking": false // Does next primitive wait for this one?
    },
    {
      "primitive_id": "p1_orient_pitch_002",
      "type_label": "SET_HEAD_PITCH_RELATIVE",
      "target_value_rad": -0.1, // Example: -0.1 radians down
      "estimated_duration_ms": 250,
      "speed_profile_hint": "ease_in_out",
      "blocking": false
    },
    {
      "primitive_id": "p1_gesture_nod_003",
      "type_label": "PERFORM_SIMPLE_NOD", // Predefined simple gesture
      "magnitude_norm": 0.7, // Normalized intensity
      "repetitions": 1,
      "estimated_duration_ms": 500,
      "speed_profile_hint": "natural",
      "blocking": true // Example: next primitive (if any) waits
    }
  ],
  "overall_movement_quality_hints": { // Simplified for Phase 1
    "general_smoothness_preference_norm": 0.7 // Suggestion for local Execution Router
  }
}
```
**Phase 1 Note:** The `abstract_motion_primitives` will be a small, predefined set (e.g., `SET_HEAD_ORIENTATION_ABS/REL`, `SET_NECKBASE_Z_LIFT_ABS/REL`, `PERFORM_PREDEFINED_GESTURE_X`). The local `Execution Router` is responsible for translating these into actual multi-joint actuator commands using its kinematics model. The Motion Large Language Model (LLM) does not output direct joint angles.

## 4. Application Programming Interface (API) Exposed by Motion Large Language Model (LLM) Service

Primarily reactive to Master Shared State System (MSSS). A direct Application Programming Interface (API) is unlikely to be needed in Phase 1. If a very specific, urgent motion adjustment is ever needed from the `Cloud Gateway` bypassing normal Master Shared State System (MSSS) directive flow, an endpoint could be added, but this is deferred.

## 5. Operational Logic (Phase 1 Simplified)

1.  **Reactive to Master Shared State System (MSSS) Directives:**
    a.  Monitors the Master Shared State System (MSSS) (e.g., relevant parts of `resolved_robot_directives_queue` or dedicated fields like `motion_task_from_decision_llm`).
    b.  When a new motion-relevant directive appears (e.g., "Orient to person_1," "Perform 'greeting_nod' gesture," "Adopt 'attentive' posture"), it fetches necessary context (e.g., target position from `environment_model`, current abstract behavioral mode).
    c.  **Plan Generation (Simplified):**
        -   Selects one or a short sequence of `abstract_motion_primitives` from its predefined library that best achieves the directive.
        -   For "orient to target," it might calculate the required abstract yaw/pitch change from a known neutral or current abstract pose.
        -   Assigns estimated durations and basic speed profile hints.
    d.  Publishes its generated abstract motion plan (as per Section 3.2) to `cloud_llm_pending_outputs.motion_llm_output` in Master Shared State System (MSSS).
2.  The (simplified) Master Shared State System (MSSS) Conflict Resolution Engine then processes this plan. If accepted, it will become part of `resolved_robot_directives_queue.motion_commands_abstract` which the `Cloud Gateway` polls and sends to the robot's Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) for the `Execution Router`.

## 6. Error Handling (Phase 1 Basic)

-   If Master Shared State System (MSSS) is unreachable when fetching context or directives, the Motion Large Language Model (LLM) logs the error and refrains from publishing new plans. It might output a "MAINTAIN_CURRENT_ABSTRACT_POSE" or "RESET_TO_NEUTRAL_ABSTRACT_POSE" directive.
-   If it cannot generate a feasible abstract plan for a given directive (e.g., target abstractly out of conceptual range, unknown gesture type requested), it should report this in its output to Master Shared State System (MSSS), perhaps with a `plan_feasibility_status_label: "failed_unsupported_directive"` and a reason.
-   If its own Large Language Model (LLM) processing fails, it should log the error and avoid publishing corrupted data.

## 7. Security

-   All interactions with Master Shared State System (MSSS) are governed by Master Shared State System (MSSS) Application Programming Interface (API) security.

The Phase 1 Motion Large Language Model (LLM) serves as a translator from high-level intentions to a structured, abstract plan that the onboard `Execution Router` can understand and implement, focusing on achieving basic directed movements and simple gestures.

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the integration plan for the Conversational Speech Model (Conversational Speech Model (CSM)) as the primary Text-to-Speech (Text-to-Speech (TTS)) engine for the A2 Robotic Assistant. The Conversational Speech Model (CSM), based on models like LLaMA 3.2-1B and utilizing Mimi audio codes (or outputting PCM directly), is chosen for its potential to deliver high-quality, natural-sounding, and custom-cloned voices.

The key objectives for Conversational Speech Model (CSM) integration are:
-   Provide expressive and natural-sounding speech output for the A2 robot.
-   Support a single, custom-cloned voice for a consistent persona.
-   Integrate seamlessly with the cloud-hosted Communication Large Language Model (LLM).
-   Minimize perceived latency through audio streaming from the cloud to the robot.
-   Ensure robust operation within the A2 hybrid cloud-local architecture.

Conversational Speech Model (CSM) will operate as a cloud-hosted service, receiving text from the A2's cloud-based Communication Large Language Model (LLM) and streaming generated audio back to the robot for playback.

### 1.1. Phase 1 Implementation Scope

For Phase 1 (Essential Core), as detailed in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`, the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) integration will focus on achieving core functionality:

-   **Voice Cloning:** Successfully clone one target voice and deploy it with the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service.
-   **Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Service Deployment (Cloud):** Deploy a containerized Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service (e.g., on RunPod) that can synthesize speech using the cloned voice.
-   **Streaming Application Programming Interface (API):** The Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service will expose an Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint that accepts text and streams audio data (e.g., raw PCM) as the response. Focus on reliable streaming.
-   **Integration with Communication Large Language Model (LLM) (Cloud):** The cloud Communication Large Language Model (LLM) will make internal Application Programming Interface (API) calls to this Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service to trigger speech synthesis.
-   **Integration with Cloud Gateway (Robot):** The `Cloud Gateway Node` on the robot will be responsible for calling the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Application Programming Interface (API) (forwarding text from the local Comm Large Language Model (LLM) Proxy which got it from resolved Master Shared State System (MSSS) directives) and receiving the audio stream.
-   **Local Audio Playback:** A local ROS 2 Humble node on the Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5 will play back the received audio stream.
-   **Latency Target:** Aim for first audio chunk playback < 700ms from the moment text is available to the cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service.
-   **Expressiveness:** Phase 1 will focus on accurate rendering of the text in the cloned voice. Fine-grained control over emotional tone or prosody via Conversational Speech Model (CSM) parameters is a Phase 2+ goal; initial expressiveness will come from the voice's inherent qualities and the Communication Large Language Model (LLM)'s text.

## 2. Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Architectural Placement

-   **Hosting:** Conversational Speech Model (CSM) will be deployed as a containerized service on a cloud platform (e.g., RunPod), alongside the other A2 cloud Large Language Model (LLM) components.
-   **Input:** Receives plain text from the (cloud) Communication Large Language Model (LLM).
-   **Output:** Streams audio data (target for Phase 1: raw PCM, e.g., 16kHz, 16-bit, mono) to the `Cloud Gateway Node` running on the A2 robot's Raspberry Pi 5.
-   **Voice Model:** Utilizes a single, pre-cloned voice model specific to the A2 robot's initial persona.

## 3. Setup and Development Environment for Conversational Speech Model (CSM) (for Cloning & Testing)

This environment is for *developing, cloning, and testing* Conversational Speech Model (CSM) locally before packaging for cloud deployment.

### 3.1. Primary Development Machine (WSL with NVIDIA RTX 4080 system)

-   Used for voice cloning, model experimentation, and building the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Docker image.
-   **Repository Setup:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm.git a2_csm_dev_main
    cd a2_csm_dev_main
    python3.10 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    huggingface-cli login
    export NO_TORCH_COMPILE=1
    ```yaml
-   Relevant forks (e.g., `isaiahbjork/csm` for voice cloning, `akashjss/sesame-csm` for Gradio UI testing) will be cloned separately for tool usage.

## 4. Voice Cloning and Customization (Phase 1 Focus)

A2 will use a single, custom-cloned voice in Phase 1.

### 4.1. Voice Cloning Process

1.  **Data Collection:** Record 2-5 minutes of high-quality, clear speech from the target voice.
2.  **Transcription:** Accurately transcribe using local Whisper (RTX 4080 system) or another reliable tool.
3.  **Model Preparation:** Use/adapt a voice cloning script (e.g., from `isaiahbjork/csm`). Configure paths to audio/transcription and the base Conversational Speech Model (CSM) model.
4.  **Execution:** Run cloning on the WSL/RTX 4080 system. Output is the cloned voice profile.
5.  **Storage:** Package the cloned voice profile into the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Docker image for cloud deployment.

### 4.2. Initial Persona Voice

-   Focus on achieving one high-quality, natural-sounding cloned voice.

## 5. Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Service Deployment (Cloud - Phase 1)

### 5.1. Dockerization

-   A `Dockerfile` will package:
    -   Base Conversational Speech Model (CSM) codebase.
    -   Python dependencies.
    -   The single cloned voice profile.
    -   An inference script (FastAPI/Flask based) to load the model/voice and expose the streaming Application Programming Interface (API).
    -   Necessary base model weights (LLaMA 3.2-1B, audio decoder).
-   **Phase 1 Note:** The inference script will be straightforward, focusing on loading one voice and synthesizing speech.

### 5.2. Application Programming Interface (API) Endpoint for Text-to-Speech (TTS) (Phase 1)

-   The Conversational Speech Model (CSM) container will expose an Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint, for example:
    -   `POST /api/v1/csm/generate_speech_stream`
    -   **Request Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "text_to_synthesize": "The text for speech.",
          "voice_id": "a2_default_voice", // Fixed to the single cloned voice in Phase 1
          "output_audio_format": "pcm_s16le_16000_mono" // Expected output format
        }
        ```
    -   **Response Body:** A streaming HTTP response (`Content-Type: audio/pcm` or `application/octet-stream` if PCM). Audio data is sent in chunks.
-   Referenced forks (`davidbrowne17/csm` for streaming, `phildougherty/sesame-tts-openai-api`, `Cerebrium/csm-truss`) provide good examples for Application Programming Interface (API) structure and deployment.

### 5.3. Streaming Implementation

-   The Conversational Speech Model (CSM) inference script MUST generate and yield audio in chunks for effective streaming. This is a core requirement for Phase 1 to manage latency.

## 6. Integration with A2 Architecture (Phase 1 Data Flow)

Refer to `a2_hybrid_architecture_overview.md` and `a2_cloud_gateway_node_design.md`.

### 6.1. Data Flow for Text-to-Speech (TTS)

1.  **Text Generation (Cloud):** The cloud Communication Large Language Model (LLM) finalizes `response_text_for_speech`.
2.  **Internal Application Programming Interface (API) Call (Cloud Comm Large Language Model (LLM) to Cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM)):** The Communication Large Language Model (LLM) service directly calls the cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) service's `/api/v1/csm/generate_speech_stream` endpoint with the text.
3.  **Speech Synthesis & Streaming Initiation (Cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM)):** Conversational Speech Model (CSM) synthesizes speech and starts streaming audio chunks.
4.  **Relay to Cloud Gateway (Conceptual):** The original request for speech effectively came *via* the Cloud Gateway (as it triggered the Comm Large Language Model (LLM) which then triggers Conversational Speech Model (CSM)). The audio stream from Conversational Speech Model (CSM) is thus part of the "response payload" that the Cloud Gateway handles.
    -   More accurately: The Cloud Gateway, after receiving a directive from Master Shared State System (MSSS) (via its polling mechanism) that includes a `speech_generation_request` (which was put there by the Comm Large Language Model (LLM) via Master Shared State System (MSSS)'s conflict resolution), will make a *new* Application Programming Interface (API) call to the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) endpoint specified in that request (or a preconfigured one).
    -   The `speech_generation_request` in Master Shared State System (MSSS) (put there by Comm Large Language Model (LLM)) looks like:
        ```json
        // From Master Shared State System (MSSS) resolved_robot_directives_queue.speech_generation_request
        {
            "text_to_speak": "Hello from A2.",
            "voice_id": "a2_default_voice",
            "csm_service_endpoint": "https://[runpod_csm_endpoint]/api/v1/csm/generate_speech_stream", // Optional, could be config in Gateway
            "request_id": "speech_req_002"
        }
```bash
5.  **Audio Reception & Local Publication (Robot - Cloud Gateway):** The Cloud Gateway calls the Conversational Speech Model (CSM) endpoint and receives the streaming audio. It then publishes these audio chunks to a local ROS 2 Humble topic (e.g., `/audio/play_stream_chunk` - `a2_interfaces/AudioStreamChunk`).
6.  **Audio Playback (Robot - Raspberry Pi 5):** An `audio_playback_node` (in `a2_audio` ROS 2 Humble package) subscribes to `/audio/play_stream_chunk` and plays the audio through the robot's speakers.

### 6.2. Latency and Synchronization (Phase 1 Focus)

-   **Target (First Audio Chunk):** < 700ms from when Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Application Programming Interface (API) is called by Gateway to first audio chunk being processable by the local playback node.
-   The `Cloud Gateway` and `audio_playback_node` must robustly handle buffering for smooth playback.
-   **Gesture Sync (Basic):** The `resolved_robot_directives_queue` from Master Shared State System (MSSS) will contain both the `speech_generation_request` and any `gesture_commands_abstract`. The `Execution Router` will receive these. For Phase 1, rough synchronization can be achieved by the Execution Router starting gestures slightly before or as the audio playback begins, based on estimated speech duration or simple "start with speech" hints. Tight lip-sync is Phase 2+.

## 7. Testing and UI Integration (Phase 1 for Conversational Speech Model (CSM))

### 7.1. Gradio UI for Local Development & Voice Tuning

-   Use `akashjss/sesame-csm` Gradio UI fork locally (WSL/RTX 4080 system) for:
    -   Rapidly testing cloned voice quality.
    -   Debugging Conversational Speech Model (CSM) model inference.
-   This is a developer tool, not part of the deployed A2 system.

### 7.2. Phase 1 Integration Testing Scenarios

-   **Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Application Programming Interface (API) Call:** Cloud Gateway successfully calls cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Application Programming Interface (API) with text and receives a valid audio stream.
-   **Audio Streaming Robustness:** Test with short and moderately long sentences.
-   **Local Playback:** Audio stream is correctly played on the robot with minimal audible gaps/jitters.
-   **End-to-End Latency:** Measure as defined in "Key Performance Metrics" in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`.

## 8. Error Handling and Fallbacks (Phase 1 Basic)

-   **Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Service Failure (Cloud):**
    -   If the Cloud Gateway's call to Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Application Programming Interface (API) fails (unreachable, HTTP error):
        -   Gateway logs the error.
        -   Gateway publishes an error status to `/cloud_gateway/status`.
        -   The robot will not speak for that turn. A local "cannot speak now" sound might be played by the `audio_playback_node` if it receives an error indication instead of audio chunks.
-   **Audio Stream Interruption:**
    -   `Cloud Gateway` should detect incomplete streams.
    -   `audio_playback_node` should handle unexpected stream termination gracefully.

## 9. Future Considerations (Beyond Phase 1)

-   Multiple voices/personas for Conversational Speech Model (CSM).
-   Control over speech expressiveness (emotion, prosody) via Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Application Programming Interface (API) parameters.
-   Local lightweight Text-to-Speech (TTS) fallback on Raspberry Pi 5/RTX 4080 system if cloud Conversational Speech Model (CSM) is completely unavailable.
-   Bandwidth optimization for audio stream if needed.

This Phase 1 Conversational Speech Model (CSM) integration focuses on delivering a reliable, custom-voiced, streamed Text-to-Speech (TTS) capability, forming a crucial part of the A2's interactive persona.

## Expressive Motion Philosophy

### Design Principles

**Non-Anthropomorphic but Emotionally Readable**
- Avoid human-like gestures that create uncanny valley effects
- Focus on abstract movements that convey clear emotional intent
- Use biomimetic inspiration without direct copying
- Prioritize emotional clarity over anatomical accuracy

**Inspired by Bird and Dog Biomechanics**
- **Bird-like Head Movements**:
  - Quick, precise orientation changes for attention
  - Tilting motions for curiosity and interest
  - Smooth tracking movements for focus
  - Alert, upright postures for engagement
- **Dog-like Platform Adjustments**:
  - Lowered stance for submission or uncertainty
  - Raised, forward-leaning posture for alertness
  - Side-to-side weight shifts for playfulness
  - Settling movements for relaxation

**Function and Expression as Equal Priorities**
- Every movement serves both functional and expressive purposes
- Sensor orientation movements convey attention and interest
- Platform adjustments communicate emotional state
- Transition movements maintain narrative continuity

### Tight Coupling Between Emotion and Motion

**Synchronization Requirements**
- Speech onset to motion: <200ms
- Emotion change to posture adjustment: <500ms
- Gesture completion aligned with speech rhythm
- Smooth transitions between emotional states

**Implementation Strategy**
- Pre-computed motion primitives for common emotions
- Real-time blending between primitives
- Predictive motion planning based on speech analysis
- Feedback-driven motion refinement

### Motion Primitive Categories

**Head Movements (Yaw/Pitch/Roll Combinations)**
- Curiosity: 15° head tilt + slight forward lean
- Attention: Quick 30° turn toward stimulus
- Confusion: Small side-to-side movements
- Agreement: Gentle nodding motion
- Interest: Forward lean + upward tilt

**Platform Movements (L16 Actuator Patterns)**
- Alert: Raised platform, forward weight shift
- Relaxed: Lowered platform, centered weight
- Playful: Rhythmic side-to-side shifts
- Uncertain: Slight backward lean, lowered stance
- Confident: Stable, centered, elevated posture

**Composite Movements (Synchronized Multi-Component)**
- Greeting: Head turn + platform raise + slight forward lean
- Listening: Head tilt + platform lower + focused orientation
- Thinking: Small head movements + neutral platform
- Excited: Quick head movements + elevated, forward platform
- Tired: Slow movements + lowered platform + relaxed posture

**Transition Movements (Smooth State Changes)**
- Attention capture: Smooth acceleration to target
- State settling: Gradual deceleration to stable position
- Emotion blending: Weighted interpolation between states
- Recovery: Return to neutral with appropriate timing

    "stt_beam_size": 1,     # Faster transcription
    "tts_quality": "medium", # Faster synthesis
    "log_level": "DEBUG"
}

PRODUCTION_CONFIG = {
    "llm_max_tokens": 512,
    "stt_beam_size": 5,
    "tts_quality": "high",
    "log_level": "INFO"
}

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the key testing and calibration procedures required for the A2 Robot during **Phase 1 (Essential Core)** of its development. The focus is on validating individual hardware components, low-level software interfaces, core safety mechanisms, and the foundational elements of the hybrid cloud-local pipeline.

These procedures are designed to support the iterative sprints and Proof of Concept (POC) goals defined in `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`. Successful completion of these tests and calibrations is crucial for building a stable and reliable robotic platform.

## 2. General Testing Principles for Phase 1

-   **Iterative Testing:** Test components and integrations as they are developed within each sprint.
-   **Verification of POC Goals:** Each sprint's testing should culminate in verifying its defined POC.
-   **Focus on Interfaces:** Pay close attention to testing the ROS 2 Humble topics, services, and Application Programming Interface (API) calls between modules.
-   **Safety First:** P0 and P1 safety tests must be passed before proceeding with more complex integrations.
-   **Log Everything:** Configure ROS 2 Humble and custom logging to capture detailed information during tests.
-   **Simulated and Physical Testing:** Use simulated environments where practical for early tests, then move to physical hardware.

## 3. Hardware and Firmware Calibration Procedures (Sprint 1 & 2 Focus)

### 3.1. Teensy 4.1 Initial Setup & Basic I/O Test

-   **Objective:** Verify Teensy 4.1 board health and basic PlatformIO compilation/upload.
-   **Procedure:**
    1.  Setup PlatformIO for Teensy 4.1.
    2.  Compile and upload a simple "blink" sketch to toggle an onboard LED.
    3.  Verify basic serial output (e.g., "Teensy 4.1 Alive!") over Universal Serial Bus (USB) to a serial monitor.
-   **Pass Criteria:** LED blinks, serial output received.

### 3.2. L16 Linear Actuator Feedback Calibration (Teensy 4.1)

-   **Relevant Doc:** `a2_teensy_firmware_design.md`
-   **Objective:** Calibrate ADC readings from L16 potentiometers to precise millimeter positions.
-   **Equipment:** Each L16 actuator, Teensy 4.1, power supply, digital calipers, test rig if available.
-   **Procedure (per actuator):**
    1.  Connect L16 feedback to Teensy 4.1 analog input. Power L16 motor separately to move it.
    2.  Run a Teensy 4.1 sketch that continuously prints the raw ADC value.
    3.  Manually (or by motor power) move actuator to full retraction. Record ADC value and physical length (0mm).
    4.  Manually move actuator to full extension (e.g., 100mm). Record ADC value and physical length.
    5.  Verify potentiometer linearity by checking ADC values at intermediate known positions (e.g., 25mm, 50mm, 75mm).
    6.  Store min/max ADC values and corresponding mm lengths in Teensy 4.1 EEPROM or as constants in firmware.
    7.  Firmware should then convert ADC to mm.
-   **Pass Criteria:** Firmware outputs position in mm accurate to +/- 1mm across the range.

### 3.3. ICM-20948 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Basic Calibration & Data Streaming (Teensy 4.1)

-   **Relevant Doc:** `a2_teensy_firmware_design.md`
-   **Objective:** Calibrate accelerometer/gyroscope offsets and verify data streaming over Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART).
-   **Equipment:** Teensy 4.1 with connected ICM-20948s (head and base), TCA9548A TCA9548A I2C multiplexer, stable flat surface.
-   **Procedure:**
    1.  Run a Teensy 4.1 sketch to read raw accelerometer and gyroscope data from both IMUs.
    2.  **Accelerometer Offset Calibration:** With Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) flat and motionless, average ~1000 readings. The X/Y averages are offsets. Z average should be ~1g; difference is offset.
    3.  **Gyroscope Offset Calibration:** With Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) motionless, average ~1000 readings. Averages are offsets (biases).
    4.  Store offsets in Teensy 4.1 EEPROM or firmware. Firmware applies these offsets before sending data.
    5.  Verify Teensy 4.1 `serialCommunicationTask` correctly packetizes and sends Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data (with applied offsets) to Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5 according to Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) protocol.
-   **Pass Criteria:**
    -   Corrected gyro data shows near zero angular velocity when stationary.
    -   Corrected accelerometer data shows ~0m/s² on X/Y and ~9.81m/s² on Z (or vice-versa depending on orientation) when flat and stationary.
    -   Raspberry Raspberry Pi 5 `teensy_interface_node` successfully receives and parses this Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data.
    -   (Phase 1: Full magnetometer calibration and advanced fusion algorithm tuning on Teensy 4.1 is optional; focus on clean, offset-corrected data for Raspberry Pi 5-side fusion).

-   **Procedure:**
    1.  Launch `dynamixel_interface_node`.
    2.  Verify node detects all configured servos (IDs, models).
    3.  Check `/dynamixel/joint_states` topic; verify it publishes plausible initial positions.
    4.  Use `ros2 topic pub` (or a simple test script) to send target position commands to individual servo command topics (e.g., `/dynamixel/command_position/head_yaw_joint std_msgs/msg/Float64 '{data: 0.5}'`).
    5.  Verify physical servo movement and updated positions on `/dynamixel/joint_states`.
    6.  Test end-stop positions for each servo.
-   **Pass Criteria:** All servos detected. Servos move to commanded positions. `/dynamixel/joint_states` reflects actual positions.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a set of basic behavioral testing scenarios for the A2 Robot during Phase 1 of its development. The primary goal of these scenarios is to validate the end-to-end functionality of the simplified hybrid cloud-local architecture, specifically the "Hello World - Spoken & Embodied" Proof of Concept (POC) targeted in Sprint 4 of `a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`.

These tests focus on verifying:
-   Basic speech interaction (Speech-to-Text (STT) -> Cloud LLMs -> Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) -> Local Playback).
-   Simple, coordinated motion and gestures accompanying speech.
-   Correct functioning of the core data pipeline through Local Shared State Cache (LSSC), Cloud Gateway, Master Shared State System (MSSS), and Execution Router.
-   Basic responsiveness and perceived coherence of the robot.

**Prerequisites:**
-   All core Phase 1 software components are deployed (local and simplified/mocked cloud services).
-   Hardware is assembled, calibrated, and basic functionality (motor movement, sensor data) is verified as per `a2_testing_calibration.md`.
-   Local Speech-to-Text (STT) (e.g., Whisper on RTX 4080 system) is operational, or a cloud Speech-to-Text (STT) service is integrated via the Cloud Gateway.
-   Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS) with the cloned voice is deployed and operational in the cloud.
-   Basic Telemetry UI is available for observing internal states.

## 2. Test Environment Setup

-   **Physical Robot:** A2 head/neck assembly fully powered on a stable test stand.
-   **Microphone:** ReSpeaker Mic Array active for user speech input.
-   **Speakers:** Onboard speakers active for robot Text-to-Speech (TTS) output.
-   **User:** A human interactor positioned in front of the robot (e.g., 1-1.5 meters).
-   **Network:** Stable internet connection for communication with cloud services.
-   **Monitoring:** Access to ROS 2 Humble logs, Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) state via Telemetry UI, and potentially cloud service logs.

## 3. Behavioral Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Greeting and Attentive Response

-   **Objective:** Verify basic Speech-to-Text (STT), cloud Large Language Model (LLM) (Comm, Decision, Motion - simplified) processing, Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS), and coordinated head orientation.
-   **User Action:** User clearly says, "Hello A2."
-   **Expected Robot Behavior Sequence:**
    1.  **(Speech-to-Text (STT)):** User's speech is transcribed locally (or via cloud Speech-to-Text (STT)). Transcription appears in Telemetry UI (e.g., from Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) `local_perception_state.stt_transcription_local`).
    2.  **(Cloud Processing Trigger):** `Cloud Gateway` sends transcription and basic context to cloud.
    3.  **(Decision Large Language Model (LLM) - Simplified):** Detects new interaction. Sets goal to "ENGAGE_USER," behavioral mode to "INTERACTIVE_GREETING." Directs Motion Large Language Model (LLM) to "ORIENT_TO_USER." Directs Comm Large Language Model (LLM) to "RESPOND_GREETING." (Outputs appear in Master Shared State System (MSSS), then Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) `active_directives_for_execution`).
    4.  **(Motion Large Language Model (LLM) - Simplified):** Generates an abstract motion primitive like "SET_HEAD_ORIENTATION_TARGET [user_estimated_pos]".
    5.  **(Communication Large Language Model (LLM) - Simplified):** Generates a simple greeting text (e.g., "Hello there!") and perhaps a "GENTLE_NOD" gesture directive. Sends text to Conversational Speech Model (CSM).
    6.  **(Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS)):** Synthesizes "Hello there!" using the cloned voice and streams audio to `Cloud Gateway`.
    7.  **(Execution & Playback - Onboard):**
        -   `Execution Router` commands head servos to orient towards the user (based on local perception or a default forward pose if user tracking isn't fully implemented in Phase 1 vision).
        -   `audio_playback_node` plays the "Hello there!" audio stream.
        -   `Execution Router` commands the "GENTLE_NOD" gesture, attempting to time it roughly with the speech.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Robot visibly orients its head/camera towards the general direction of the user (or to a default "attentive" forward pose).
    -   Robot audibly speaks a coherent greeting (e.g., "Hello there!") in the cloned voice.
    -   Robot performs a simple nod gesture around the time of speech.
    -   Total response time (end of user speech to start of robot speech) is within Phase 1 targets (e.g., < 2.5 seconds).
    -   No system errors logged. Relevant state changes observed in Telemetry UI.
-   **Variations:**
    -   User says, "Hi robot."
    -   User is slightly off-center.

### Scenario 2: Simple Question & Informative Response with Basic Gesture

-   **Objective:** Verify a slightly more complex interaction involving a question, a factual (pre-programmed for Phase 1 Large Language Model (LLM)) response, and a different basic gesture.
-   **User Action:** After completing Scenario 1, user asks, "What can you do?"
-   **Expected Robot Behavior Sequence:**
    1.  **(Speech-to-Text (STT) & Cloud Trigger):** As above.
    2.  **(Decision Large Language Model (LLM) - Simplified):** Identifies intent "QUERY_CAPABILITIES." Maintains "ENGAGE_USER" goal. Directs Comm Large Language Model (LLM) to "INFORM_BASIC_CAPABILITIES."
    3.  **(Communication Large Language Model (LLM) - Simplified):** Generates a short, predefined text response (e.g., "I can see, hear, and speak. I am learning more!"). Generates a "SLIGHT_HEAD_TILT_CURIOUS" gesture directive. Sends text to Conversational Speech Model (CSM).
    4.  **(Motion Large Language Model (LLM) - Simplified):** May receive a directive to "MAINTAIN_ATTENTIVE_POSTURE" or similar from Decision Large Language Model (LLM).
    5.  **(Conversational Speech Model (CSM) Text-to-Speech (TTS)):** Synthesizes the informative response.
    6.  **(Execution & Playback - Onboard):**
        -   Robot maintains general orientation towards user.
        -   `audio_playback_node` plays the informative audio.
        -   `Execution Router` commands the "SLIGHT_HEAD_TILT_CURIOUS" gesture.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Robot delivers the informative spoken response in the cloned voice.
    -   Robot performs the "slight head tilt" gesture.
    -   Interaction remains coherent.
    -   Response time acceptable for Phase 1.
-   **Variations:**
    -   User asks, "What is your name?" (Comm Large Language Model (LLM) gives predefined name).

### Scenario 3: Response to Sound from Unexpected Direction (Testing Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) interplay)

-   **Objective:** Verify that a local Fast Path Reflex (Loud Noise Orienting) can occur, be reported, and the cloud system can (even if simply) acknowledge or adapt to it.
-   **Setup:** Robot is "idle" or engaged with a user in front. Another person off to one side (e.g., 90 degrees left) makes a sharp, loud clap.
-   **Expected Robot Behavior Sequence:**
    1.  **(Local Audio Processing & Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS)):** `audio_event_processor_node` (if implemented, or basic DOA from mic array) detects loud sound and its direction. `Local Fast Path Reflex System` triggers "Loud Noise Orienting Reflex."
    2.  **(P1 Execution):** `Execution Router` receives P1 command from Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) to quickly orient head towards the clap's DOA. Robot head moves rapidly.
    3.  **(Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) & Cloud Gateway):** Fast Path Reflex System (FPRS) trigger event and new head orientation are updated in Local Shared State Cache (LSSC). `Cloud Gateway` sends this updated context (including "reflex_event: LOUD_NOISE_ORIENT") to Master Shared State System (MSSS).
    4.  **(Decision Large Language Model (LLM) - Simplified):** Receives updated context indicating a reflex occurred and head is now oriented differently. It might:
        -   Set a short-term goal like "INVESTIGATE_SOUND_SOURCE."
        -   Direct Communication Large Language Model (LLM) to say something like, "What was that?" or "I heard a noise."
        -   Direct Motion Large Language Model (LLM) to "MAINTAIN_ORIENTATION_TO_SOUND_SOURCE_BRIEFLY."
    5.  **(Comm Large Language Model (LLM), Conversational Speech Model (CSM), Execution - Simplified):** Robot speaks the short phrase and holds orientation for a moment.
    6.  **(Decision Large Language Model (LLM) - Timeout/Next State):** After a short period, if no further stimulus from sound source, Decision Large Language Model (LLM) might direct robot to return to "IDLE_SCAN" or re-orient to original user if one was present.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Robot rapidly orients towards the loud sound (P1 reflex).
    -   Robot makes a simple spoken acknowledgment related to the sound (cloud loop).
    -   System remains stable and coherent.
    -   Telemetry UI shows the reflex event and subsequent cloud-derived directives.
-   **Note:** For Phase 1, the cloud response to the reflex might be very simple, like just turning back to the user after a pause, or a fixed verbal response. The key is testing the reporting of the reflex and a basic cognitive loop acknowledging it.

### Scenario 4: Cloud Disconnect & Basic Fallback Behavior

-   **Objective:** Verify the robot enters a predefined simple "offline" behavior when cloud connectivity is lost.
-   **Setup:** Robot is interacting or idle.
-   **Action:** Simulate a network disconnection for the `Cloud Gateway Node` (e.g., disconnect Wi-Fi/Ethernet, or stop mock cloud services if testing locally).
-   **Expected Robot Behavior Sequence:**
    1.  `Cloud Gateway` fails to reach cloud services after retries. Updates `cloud_sync_status.connectivity_to_cloud` in Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) to "disconnected."
    2.  (If implemented) A local "System Supervisor" node or the `Execution Router` itself detects this state in Local Shared State Cache (LSSC).
    3.  `Execution Router` (or Supervisor instructing ER) activates a predefined local P2 "offline_idle_behavior" (e.g., slow, gentle head scanning movement; or a specific "disconnected" pose).
    4.  Robot ceases attempts at complex interaction or speech requiring cloud LLMs/Conversational Speech Model (CSM).
    5.  Local P0 and P1 safety reflexes remain active.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Robot visibly transitions to the predefined offline behavior.
    -   No errors or crashes due to cloud unavailability.
    -   P0/P1 safety reflexes can still be triggered and function correctly.
    -   Telemetry UI reflects "disconnected" status.
-   **Follow-up Test:** Restore network connectivity. Verify `Cloud Gateway` reconnects, updates Local Shared State Cache (LSSC) status, and robot can resume cloud-based interactions.

## 4. General Observation Criteria for All Scenarios

-   **Smoothness of Motion:** Are movements reasonably smooth for Phase 1 (no excessive jerkiness)?
-   **Voice Quality:** Is the cloned voice clear and intelligible?
-   **System Stability:** Does the robot operate without software crashes or hardware malfunctions?
-   **Log Review:** Check ROS logs and application logs for errors or unexpected warnings.
-   **Telemetry UI:** Correlate observed behavior with internal state data displayed on the UI.

These Phase 1 behavioral scenarios are designed to be achievable with the simplified component implementations and provide foundational validation of the overall hybrid architecture.

# A2‑Agents Backend — Single Source of Truth
Place this file at `A2/.A2‑agents/REFERENCE.md`.

## 1 Purpose
Define backend architecture, message contract, repo layout, env vars, and generation prompts for the thread‑safe multi‑agent toolchain.

## 2 Context
* Main robot repo: `https://github.com/War-Against-Work/A2.git`
* Hidden dev‑tool directory: `.A2‑agents/` (ignored by robot build).
* Submodules mirror operational components; agents need scoped access only.

## 3 High‑Level Architecture

UI  ⇄  API‑Gateway  ⇄  NATS  ⇄  {Orchestrator‑Logic, Agent‑Manager, Repo‑Proxy, CI‑Trigger}
↕
Redis  (hot mem)
↕
Postgres (cold history)

Component | Core job | Ports | Image tag
----------|----------|-------|----------
api-gateway | REST+SSE ingress, auth | 8080 | a2/agents-api
orchestrator-logic | routing / memory / policy | – | a2/agents-orch
agent-manager | spawn Claude‑code, stream chunks | – | a2/agent-mgr
repo-proxy | path‑ACL wrapper for Git | 7000 | a2/repo-proxy
ci-trigger | fires GitHub Actions from QA events | – | a2/ci-trigger
nats | message bus | 4222 | nats:latest
redis | hot memory | 6379 | redis:6-alpine
postgres | cold history | 5432 | postgres:15-alpine

## 4 Message Topology
Subject                         | Producer                | Consumer(s)
--------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------
thread.\<id>.from_ui            | API‑Gateway             | Orchestrator‑Logic
thread.\<id>.agent.\*           | Agent‑Manager           | Orchestrator‑Logic
thread.\<id>.to_ui              | Orchestrator‑Logic      | API‑Gateway (SSE)
thread.\<id>.broadcast          | Orchestrator‑Logic      | All agents (fan‑out)

## 5 Routing Rules
1. UI message prefixed `@<agent>` → direct to that agent.
2. Otherwise → OrchestratorAgent first.
3. SafetyEngineer may publish `SAFETY‑BLOCK` to any subject → Orchestrator halts thread.
4. Orchestrator trims Redis list `conv:{thread}` to 100 entries; background flushes to Postgres JSONB.

## 6 Persistent Memory
Key                   | Type    | Notes
----------------------|---------|------
`conv:{thread}`       | Redis list | recent 100 JSON msgs
`threads`             | Redis set  | active thread IDs
`claude:{thread}`     | Redis hash | {agent_role: anthropic_id}
`history` table       | Postgres  | archived conv chunks (thread, agent, ts, msg JSON)

## 7 Service Endpoints
Method & Path                      | Summary
---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------
POST /agents/{role}/threads        | spawn Claude instance, returns thread_id
POST /threads/{id}/messages        | user → thread message
GET  /threads/{id}/stream          | SSE event feed
POST /orchestrator/command         | admin (pause, kill, dump state)
GET  /repo/<path>                  | proxy read with ACL
PUT  /repo/<path>                  | proxy write (PR) with ACL

## II. CURRENT SESSION FOCUS & TASK

**1. Current Sprint (from `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-docs/a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md`):**
   - "Sprint 1: Onboard Foundation, Safety & CI Setup (Weeks 1-4)"

**2. Specific Component/Module & Repository for this Session:**
   - Component: "Teensy Firmware: Core Project Setup, RTOS Tasks, and Basic UART Communication Logic"
   - Repository: `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/`

**3. Detailed Task Description for this Session:**
   -The overall goal for this session is to establish the foundational elements of the Teensy 4.1 firmware project. This includes:
    1.  Initialize/confirm the PlatformIO project structure within the `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/` repository. This includes creating a `platformio.ini` file configured for Teensy 4.1 and FreeRTOS.
    2.  In `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/src/main.cpp`, implement the basic FreeRTOS task stubs for `safetyMonitorTask`, `actuatorFeedbackTask`, `imuProcessingTask`, `serialCommunicationTask`, and `heartbeatTask` as outlined in `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-docs/teensy_firmware_design.md` (Section 3.1). Ensure tasks are created and the scheduler is started.
    3.  Create header (`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files for a UART communications module (e.g., `serial_comms.h`, `serial_comms.cpp` in `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/src/` or a `lib/` subdirectory).
    4.  In this UART module, define the UART packet structure (start bytes, length, command ID, payload, checksum) as per `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-docs/teensy_firmware_design.md` (Section 4.1). Implement helper functions for packet creation (populating fields, calculating CRC16-CCITT checksum) and basic packet validation (checking start bytes, length, checksum).
    5.  Implement the `serialCommunicationTask` to handle sending packets from a FreeRTOS queue and receiving bytes from UART into a buffer for later parsing. Initially, it does not need to fully parse complex incoming packets, just detect potential start of packets.
    6.  Implement the `heartbeatTask` to blink an LED (e.g., `LED_BUILTIN`) and prepare a simple status/version packet (e.g., `CMD_TEENSY_FIRMWARE_VERSION` or a basic `CMD_TEENSY_TELEMETRY_PACKET` with placeholder data) to be sent via the `serialCommunicationTask` periodically (e.g., every 1 second).

**4. Primary Design Document(s) to Reference for THIS TASK (absolute paths):**
   - `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-docs/teensy_firmware_design.md` (Especially Sections 3.1 "RTOS Tasks", 4.1 "Frame Structure", 4.2 "Message Types")
   - `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-docs/a2_phase_1_implementation_priorities.md` (For Sprint 1 goals)

**5. Relevant Code File(s) to Create/Modify for THIS TASK (absolute paths):**
   - Create/Modify: `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/platformio.ini`
   - Create/Modify: `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/src/main.cpp`
   - Create: `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/src/serial_comms.h` (or `include/serial_comms.h`)
   - Create: `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/src/serial_comms.cpp`
   - Create: `/Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2/a2-teensy-firmware/src/config.h` (for constants like LED pin, UART settings - optional, good practice)

**(Optional) Paste RELEVANT snippets of existing code from the files above if needed for specific modifications:**
   ```text
   // No existing code yet for these new files.
   ```

**6. Specific Questions or Assistance Needed from Claude for THIS TASK:**
   - "Provide a well-structured `platformio.ini` file for a Teensy 4.1 project using FreeRTOS. Include common/useful build flags and library dependency management if any standard libraries are good for CRC or FreeRTOS itself."
   - "Suggest C++ struct(s) or class(es) for representing the UART packet and for the `CMD_TEENSY_FIRMWARE_VERSION` payload. Include a function for calculating CRC16-CCITT checksum over a buffer."
   - "Outline the C++ code structure for `serial_comms.h` and `serial_comms.cpp`, including function prototypes for initializing UART, sending a prepared packet (e.g., from a buffer/struct), and a non-blocking receive function to be called by `serialCommunicationTask`."
   - "Provide the FreeRTOS task creation calls in `main.cpp` for all five tasks, along with basic task function skeletons (loops with `vTaskDelayUntil` or similar for periodicity)."
   - "Show an example implementation of the `heartbeatTask` that toggles `LED_BUILTIN` and queues a version packet for sending by `serialCommunicationTask` using a FreeRTOS queue."
   - "Illustrate the core loop of `serialCommunicationTask`, showing how it might check a FreeRTOS queue for outgoing packets and check the UART for incoming bytes, buffering them for parsing (actual parsing of incoming can be a later step)."

   REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
   ```

   For Vue (frontend/.env.local):
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
   VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
   ```

2. **API Client** - Update frontend API calls to use the backend endpoints:

   ```javascript
   // Frontend API service example
   const API_BASE = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080';

   export const agentAPI = {
     // Spawn a new agent thread
     spawnAgent: async (role, initialPrompt) => {
       const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/agents/${role}/threads`, {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ initial_prompt: initialPrompt })
       });
       return response.json();
     },

     // Send message to thread
     sendMessage: async (threadId, content) => {
       const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/threads/${threadId}/messages`, {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ content })
       });
       return response.json();
     },

     // Connect to SSE stream
     connectToStream: (threadId, onMessage) => {
       const eventSource = new EventSource(`${API_BASE}/threads/${threadId}/stream`);

       eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
         const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
         onMessage(data);
       };

       eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
         console.error('SSE Error:', error);
         eventSource.close();
       };

       return eventSource;
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Agent Components** - Update UI components to display agents from REFERENCE.md:

   ```javascript
   const AGENT_ROLES = [
     'OrchestratorAgent',
     'ResearchAgent',
     'FirmwareEngineer',
     'ROSDeveloper',
     'IntegrationSpecialist',
     'SafetyEngineer',
     'DocumentationMaintainer',
     'QATester'
   ];

   // Agent selector component
   const AgentSelector = ({ onSelect }) => (
     <select onChange={(e) => onSelect(e.target.value)}>
       <option value="">Select an agent...</option>
       {AGENT_ROLES.map(role => (
         <option key={role} value={role}>{role}</option>
       ))}
     </select>
   );
   ```

4. **Thread Management** - Implement thread state management:

   ```javascript
   // Thread state example
   const [threads, setThreads] = useState({});
   const [activeThread, setActiveThread] = useState(null);
   const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

   const createThread = async (agentRole) => {
     const { thread_id } = await agentAPI.spawnAgent(agentRole, 'Hello!');
     setThreads(prev => ({
       ...prev,
       [thread_id]: { role: agentRole, messages: [] }
     }));
     setActiveThread(thread_id);

     // Connect to SSE stream
     const eventSource = agentAPI.connectToStream(thread_id, (data) => {
       setMessages(prev => [...prev, data]);
     });
   };
   ```

5. **Message Routing UI** - Implement @ mention routing:

   ```javascript
   // Parse @ mentions in message input
   const parseMessage = (content) => {
     const mentionPattern = /^@(\w+)\s+(.+)/;
     const match = content.match(mentionPattern);

     if (match) {
       return {
         targetAgent: match[1],
         message: match[2],
         isDirect: true
       };
     }

     return {
       targetAgent: 'OrchestratorAgent',
       message: content,
       isDirect: false
     };
   };
   ```

6. **Multi-Panel Layout** - Implement the multi-panel view from REFERENCE.md:

   ```javascript
   // Layout for multiple agent panels
   const MultiAgentView = () => (
     <div className="agent-panels">
       <div className="orchestrator-panel">
         <h2>Orchestrator Overview</h2>
         {/* Thread list, routing status */}
       </div>

       <div className="agent-grid">
         {AGENT_ROLES.map(role => (
           <div key={role} className="agent-panel">
             <h3>{role}</h3>
             {/* Agent-specific messages */}
           </div>
         ))}
       </div>
     </div>
   );
   ```

7. **Update package.json proxy** (if using Create React App):

   ```json
   {
     "proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
   }
   ```

8. **CORS handling** - The API Gateway already has CORS enabled, but ensure frontend runs on expected port (3000).

Test the integration:
1. Start backend: `cd a2-agents && make up`
2. Start frontend: `cd a2-agents/frontend && npm start`
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Try spawning an agent and sending messages
Read a2-agents/REFERENCE.md for full system context.

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT DELETE ANY EXISTING FILES. ONLY UPDATE OR ADD NEW FILES.**

Update the existing a2-agents/docker-compose.yaml (or create if missing) matching the architecture in REFERENCE.md section 3:
- api-gateway (fastapi, port 8080, image tag a2/agents-api)
- orchestrator-logic (image tag a2/agents-orch)
- agent-manager (image tag a2/agent-mgr)
- repo-proxy (port 7000, image tag a2/repo-proxy)
- ci-trigger (image tag a2/ci-trigger)
- nats (latest, expose 4222)
- redis (6-alpine, port 6379)
- postgres (15-alpine, db=a2_agents, user=a2user)

Requirements:
- Services under ./services/{service_name} build contexts
- Add health check for NATS: nc -z localhost 4222
- Add health check for postgres: pg_isready -U a2user -d a2_agents
- Use environment variables from REFERENCE.md section 8
- Create volumes: redis-data, postgres-data, repo-data
- Single shared network: a2-network
- Add proper service dependencies with conditions
- Add frontend service if needed for development
- Configure frontend to connect to api-gateway on port 8080

Reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/
```

## 00b-frontend-integration.txt
```
Read a2-agents/REFERENCE.md and check a2-agents/frontend structure.

Add frontend service to docker-compose.yaml if it's a React/Node app:

```yaml
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
      - REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
    depends_on:
      - api-gateway
    networks:
      - a2-network
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

Or if frontend is static files, add nginx service:

```yaml
  frontend:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend/dist:/usr/share/nginx/html
      - ./frontend/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - api-gateway
    networks:
      - a2-network
```

Update frontend configuration to connect to backend:
- API endpoints: http://localhost:8080
- SSE streams: http://localhost:8080/threads/{id}/stream
- WebSocket (if used): ws://localhost:8080

Create frontend/.env.local if React:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_SSE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

**PRESERVE EXISTING FILES - Only create new files in a2-agents/services/api_gateway/**

Generate FastAPI service in a2-agents/services/api_gateway/main.py with:

Routes (section 7):
- POST /agents/{role}/threads - spawn new agent thread
- POST /threads/{id}/messages - send message to thread
- GET /threads/{id}/stream - SSE event stream
- POST /orchestrator/command - admin commands

Pydantic models:
```python
class MsgIn(BaseModel):
    content: str
    metadata: dict = {}

class MsgOut(BaseModel):
    thread_id: str
    agent: str
    content: str

    status: str

class OrchestratorCommand(BaseModel):
    action: Literal["pause", "kill", "dump_state"]
    thread_id: Optional[str] = None
```

NATS integration (section 4):
- Publish to `thread.<id>.from_ui` for incoming messages
- Subscribe to `thread.<id>.to_ui` for SSE streaming
- Use nats-py client with connection to NATS_URL env var

SSE implementation:
- Use async generator pattern
- Set media_type='text/event-stream'
- Format: "data: {json}\n\n"
- Include heartbeat every 30s

Requirements:
- Health check endpoint: GET /health
- CORS middleware for browser access
- Proper error handling with HTTPException
- Connection pooling for NATS

```
Read a2-agents/REFERENCE.md for full system context.

**PRESERVE EXISTING FILES - Only create new files in a2-agents/services/agent_manager/**

Write Python service in a2-agents/services/agent_manager/main.py:

Core functionality:
- POST /spawn endpoint accepting (role, thread_id, initial_prompt)
- Use anthropic.messages.create with stream=True
- Map agent roles to Claude settings (e.g., ResearchAgent → claude-3-opus, temp=0.7)

Anthropic streaming:
```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'))

async def spawn_claude(role: str, thread_id: str, prompt: str):
    with client.messages.stream(
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
        max_tokens=4096,
        temperature=0.7,
        system=f"You are {role}. {get_role_context(role)}",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    ) as stream:
        for event in stream:
            if event.type == "content_block_delta":
                chunk = event.delta.text
                # Publish to NATS
```

NATS publishing (section 4):
- Publish each chunk to `thread.<thread_id>.agent.<role>`
- Message format: {"chunk": str, "role": str, "timestamp": datetime}

Redis state (section 6):
- Store in hash `claude:<thread_id>` → {role: anthropic_conversation_id}
- Use redis-py with connection pooling

Agent role mappings from lovable spec:
- OrchestratorAgent: system prompt includes routing rules
- ResearchAgent: includes web search capability hint
- FirmwareEngineer: includes Teensy 4.1 context
- ROSDeveloper: includes ROS 2 Humble context
- SafetyEngineer: includes SAFETY-BLOCK privilege

Requirements:
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM
- Retry logic for Anthropic API (exponential backoff)
- Health endpoint exposing agent count

Also create:
- a2-agents/services/agent_manager/requirements.txt
- a2-agents/services/agent_manager/Dockerfile

## 03-orchestrator-logic-safe.txt
```
Read a2-agents/REFERENCE.md for full system context, especially sections 4-6.

**PRESERVE EXISTING FILES - Only create new files in a2-agents/services/orchestrator_logic/**

Build a2-agents/services/orchestrator_logic/main.py:

NATS subscriptions:
- Subscribe to wildcard `thread.*` to catch all thread traffic
- Parse subject to extract thread_id, source type (from_ui, agent.*, etc)

Routing implementation (section 5):
```python
def route_message(thread_id: str, msg: dict) -> List[str]:
    content = msg.get('content', '')

    # Rule 1: Direct routing
    if content.startswith('@'):
        target = extract_agent_name(content)
        return [f"thread.{thread_id}.agent.{target}"]

    # Rule 2: Default to OrchestratorAgent
    if msg.get('source') == 'ui':
        return [f"thread.{thread_id}.agent.OrchestratorAgent"]

    # Rule 3: Safety block
    if msg.get('type') == 'SAFETY-BLOCK':
        halt_thread(thread_id)
        return []

    # OrchestratorAgent decides broadcast
    if should_broadcast(msg):
        return [f"thread.{thread_id}.broadcast"]

    return determine_targets(msg)
```

Memory management (section 6):
- Append messages to Redis list `conv:{thread_id}`
- Trim to 100 most recent: LTRIM conv:{thread_id} -100 -1
- Track active threads in Redis set `threads`
- Background task every 60s:
  - Batch read old messages beyond 100
  - Bulk insert to Postgres `history` table
  - Schema: (id, thread_id, agent, timestamp, message JSONB)

Thread lifecycle:
- Create thread: add to `threads` set
- Archive thread: move all Redis data to Postgres, remove from set
- Thread states: active, paused, archived

Special handling:
- SafetyEngineer SAFETY-BLOCK: immediately halt, notify all agents
- OrchestratorAgent can open/close threads
- Rate limiting: track in Redis, 30 msgs/min per agent

Postgres schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    thread_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    agent VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    message JSONB NOT NULL,
    INDEX idx_thread_time (thread_id, timestamp)
);

CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    agent VARCHAR(64),
    action VARCHAR(128),
    details JSONB
);
```

Requirements:
- Async event loop with asyncio
- Graceful shutdown preserving memory
- Publish UI updates to `thread.<id>.to_ui`
- Health check with thread count

Also create:
- a2-agents/services/orchestrator_logic/requirements.txt

        agent = payload.get('agent')
        return agent
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        abort(401)
```

ACL enforcement (section 11):
```python
ACL_MATRIX = {
    'FirmwareEngineer': ['teensy-firmware/', 'firmware/'],
    'ROSDeveloper': ['ros-workspace/', 'ros2_ws/'],
    'DocumentationMaintainer': ['docs/', 'guides/'],

    for allowed in allowed_paths:
        if path.startswith(allowed):
            return True
    return False
```

Git operations with pygit2:
```python
import pygit2

# GET /repo/<path>
def read_file(repo_path: str):
    repo = pygit2.Repository('/var/repos/A2')
    obj = repo.revparse_single(f'HEAD:{repo_path}')

    # 1. Create feature branch
    # 2. Write file
    # 3. Commit with message f"[{agent}] Update {repo_path}"
    # 4. Push to origin
    # 5. Create PR via GitHub API
```

GitHub PR creation:
```python
import requests

        json=data,
        headers=headers
    )
```

Audit logging:
- Log all write attempts to Postgres `audit_log` table
- Include: timestamp, agent, action, path, success/failure

Submodule handling:
- Check if path maps to submodule from env.submodules
- Use appropriate repo URL for operations

Requirements:
- Port 7000
- Mount /var/repos volume
- Health check endpoint
- Request logging with correlation IDs
- Rate limiting per agent

**CRITICAL: COMMIT ALL EXISTING WORK BEFORE ANY GIT OPERATIONS**

First, check git status and commit any uncommitted work:

```bash
cd /Users/aaronlax/Projects/A2
git status

# If there are uncommitted changes:
git add -A
git commit -m "WIP: Save all existing work before a2-agents git setup"

# Change to a2-agents directory
cd a2-agents
```

Then initialize git repository safely:

```bash
# Only init if not already a git repo
if [ ! -d .git ]; then
    git init
fi

# Add remote only if not already added
if ! git remote | grep -q origin; then
    git remote add origin https://github.com/War-Against-Work/thread-safe-agents
fi

# A2-Agents: Thread-Safe Multi-Agent Backend

Microservices backend for orchestrating Claude-powered agents working on the A2 robot project.

## Architecture

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for complete system documentation.

## Quick Start

1. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

2. Start services:
   ```bash
   make setup
   make up
   ```

3. Check health:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

## Services

- **API Gateway** (8080): REST/SSE interface
- **Orchestrator Logic**: Message routing and memory
- **Agent Manager**: Claude instance lifecycle
- **Repo Proxy** (7000): Git operations with ACL
- **CI Trigger**: GitHub Actions integration

## Development

```bash
make logs          # View all logs
make shell-api     # Shell into API container
make test          # Run tests
make down          # Stop everything
```
